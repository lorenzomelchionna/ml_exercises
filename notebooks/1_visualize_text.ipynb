       " 'Asphalt/bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as \"oil sands\" in Alberta, Canada, and the similar \"tar sands\" in Utah, US. The Canadian province of Alberta has most of the world\\'s reserves of natural bitumen, in three huge deposits covering 142,000 square kilometres (55,000 sq mi), an area larger than England or New York state. These bituminous sands contain 166 billion barrels (26.4×10^9 m3) of commercially established oil reserves, giving Canada the third largest oil reserves in the world. and produce over 2.3 million barrels per day (370×10^3 m3/d) of heavy crude oil and synthetic crude oil. Although historically it was used without refining to pave roads, nearly all of the bitumen is now used as raw material for oil refineries in Canada and the United States.',\n",
       " 'The first use of asphalt/bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples. On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the Tongva, Luiseño and Chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits. All three used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations. It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water. Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.',\n",
       " 'When maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements, such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface, the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures. The asphalt/bitumen in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes. With some 95% of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt, a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year. According to industry surveys conducted annually by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Asphalt Pavement Association, more than 99% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.',\n",
       " 'In Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products: The Suncor Energy upgrader near Fort McMurray, Alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel; the Syncrude Canada, Canadian Natural Resources, and Nexen upgraders near Fort McMurray produce synthetic crude oil; and the Shell Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery. A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near Redwater, Alberta, will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants.',\n",
       " 'Asphalt/bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 °C (302 °F). Sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called \"bitumen feedstock\", or BFS. Some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt/bitumen, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns.',\n",
       " 'The Albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans. After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman Coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the exploitation rights were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale.',\n",
       " 'The word asphalt is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French asphalte, based on Late Latin asphalton, asphaltum, which is the latinisation of the Greek ἄσφαλτος (ásphaltos, ásphalton), a word meaning \"asphalt/bitumen/pitch\", which perhaps derives from ἀ-, \"without\" and σφάλλω (sfallō), \"make fall\". Note that in French, the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the \"asphaltic concrete\" used to pave roads. It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically Herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall. From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (asphalte) and English (\"asphaltum\" and \"asphalt\").',\n",
       " 'The terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance. In American English, asphalt (or asphalt cement) is the carefully refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils. Outside the United States, the product is often called bitumen. Geologists often prefer the term bitumen. Common usage often refers to various forms of asphalt/bitumen as \"tar\", such as at the La Brea Tar Pits. Another archaic term for asphalt/bitumen is \"pitch\".',\n",
       " 'The great majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum. Nonetheless, large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature. Naturally occurring deposits of asphalt/bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic algae (diatoms) and other once-living things. These remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived. Under the heat (above 50 °C) and pressure of burial deep in the earth, the remains were transformed into materials such as asphalt/bitumen, kerogen, or petroleum.',\n",
       " \"The world's largest deposit of natural bitumen, known as the Athabasca oil sands is located in the McMurray Formation of Northern Alberta. This formation is from the early Cretaceous, and is composed of numerous lenses of oil-bearing sand with up to 20% oil. Isotopic studies attribute the oil deposits to be about 110 million years old. Two smaller but still very large formations occur in the Peace River oil sands and the Cold Lake oil sands, to the west and southeast of the Athabasca oil sands, respectively. Of the Alberta bitumen deposits, only parts of the Athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining. The other 80% has to be produced by oil wells using enhanced oil recovery techniques like steam-assisted gravity drainage.\",\n",
       " 'Bitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.[not in citation given]',\n",
       " 'The first British patent for the use of asphalt/bitumen was \\'Cassell\\'s patent asphalte or bitumen\\' in 1834. Then on 25 November 1837, Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt (patent #7849), for use in asphalte pavement, having seen it employed in France and Belgium when visiting with Frederick Walter Simms, who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to Britain. Dr T. Lamb Phipson writes that his father, Samuel Ryland Phipson, a friend of Claridge, was also \"instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement (in 1836)\". Indeed, mastic pavements had been previously employed at Vauxhall by a competitor of Claridge, but without success.',\n",
       " 'Roads in the US have been paved with materials that include asphalt/bitumen since at least 1870, when a street in front of the Newark, NJ City Hall was paved. In many cases, these early pavings were made from naturally occurring \"bituminous rock\", such as at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in Ritchie County, West Virginia from 1852 to 1873. In 1876, asphalt-based paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial. Asphalt/bitumen was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.',\n",
       " 'In 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving asphalt/bitumen, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century. On the London stockmarket, there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France, Germany and England. And numerous patents were granted in France, with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in England due to their similarity to each other. In England, \"Claridge\\'s was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s\"',\n",
       " \"The value of the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen were not. The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the bitumen to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to 300 barrels (50 m3) per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a Provincial Historic Site.\",\n",
       " 'Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels (210×10^3 m3) per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.',\n",
       " 'A number of technologies allow asphalt/bitumen to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form \"cutbacks\" with reduced melting point, or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt/bitumen into an emulsion. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt/bitumen and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, cationic and anionic. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.',\n",
       " 'Naturally occurring crude asphalt/bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from \"Oil sands\", currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world\\'s supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world. The Athabasca oil sands is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods. Because of oil price increases after 2003, producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about 2.3 million barrels (370,000 m3) per day and was projected to rise to 4.4 million barrels (700,000 m3) per day by 2020. The total amount of crude asphalt/bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about 310 billion barrels (50×10^9 m3), which at a rate of 4,400,000 barrels per day (700,000 m3/d) would last about 200 years.',\n",
       " 'Roofing shingles account for most of the remaining asphalt/bitumen consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics. Asphalt/bitumen is used to make Japan black, a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel, and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink, and to make the color much darker.[citation needed] Asphalt/bitumen is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.',\n",
       " 'The expression \"bitumen\" originated in the Sanskrit, where we find the words jatu, meaning \"pitch,\" and jatu-krit, meaning \"pitch creating\", \"pitch producing\" (referring to coniferous or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu-men (pertaining to pitch), and by others, pixtumens (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to bitumen, thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word cwidu (mastix), the German word Kitt (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word kvada.',\n",
       " 'Asphalt/bitumen can sometimes be confused with \"coal tar\", which is a visually similar black, thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal. During the early and mid-20th century when town gas was produced, coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac, which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian oil sands, both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar. Pitch is another term sometimes used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen, as in Pitch Lake.',\n",
       " 'One hundred years after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon described in his work Observations in 1553 that pissasphalto, a mixture of pitch and bitumen, was used in Dubrovnik for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in Venice where it could be bought by anyone. An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by \"a certain Monsieur d\\'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel\", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – \"principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth\", which at that time made the water unusable. \"He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces\" in palaces, \"the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation\". But it was generally neglected in France until the revolution of 1830. Then, in the 1830s, there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used \"for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes\". Its rise in Europe was \"a sudden phenomenon\", after natural deposits were found \"in France at Osbann (BasRhin), the Parc (l\\'Ain) and the Puy-de-la-Poix (Puy-de-Dome)\", although it could also be made artificially. One of the earliest uses in France was the laying of about 24,000 square yards of Seyssel asphalt at the Place de la Concorde in 1835.',\n",
       " 'In 1838, Claridge obtained patents in Scotland on 27 March, and Ireland on 23 April, and in 1851 extensions were sought for all three patents, by the trustees of a company previously formed by Claridge. This was Claridge\\'s Patent Asphalte Company, formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to Britain \"Asphalte in its natural state from the mine at Pyrimont Seysell in France\", and \"laid one of the first asphalt pavements in Whitehall\". Trials were made of the pavement in 1838 on the footway in Whitehall, the stable at Knightsbridge Barracks, \"and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from Waterloo Place to St. James Park\". \"The formation in 1838 of Claridge\\'s Patent Asphalte Company (with a distinguished list of aristocratic patrons, and Marc and Isambard Brunel as, respectively, a trustee and consulting engineer), gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry\". \"By the end of 1838, at least two other companies, Robinson\\'s and the Bastenne company, were in production\", with asphalt being laid as paving at Brighton, Herne Bay, Canterbury, Kensington, the Strand, and a large floor area in Bunhill-row, while meantime Claridge\\'s Whitehall paving \"continue(d) in good order\".',\n",
       " 'Canada has the world\\'s largest deposit of natural bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands and Canadian First Nations along the Athabasca River had long used it to waterproof their canoes. In 1719, a Cree Indian named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample for trade to Henry Kelsey of the Hudson’s Bay Company, who was the first recorded European to see it. However, it wasn\\'t until 1787 that fur trader and explorer Alexander MacKenzie saw the Athabasca oil sands and said, \"At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance.\"',\n",
       " 'Mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt (asphalt concrete) in that it has a higher asphalt/bitumen (binder) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% added asphalt/bitumen. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of 210 °C (410 °F) and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 millimeters (0.79 inches) thick.',\n",
       " 'Because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with natural-gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil, called synbit. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional crude oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as Western Canadian Select. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as Mexican Mayan or Arabian Dubai Crude.',\n",
       " 'Asphalt/bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites. However, detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct. The vast Alberta bitumen resources are believed to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals, mainly algae, that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered Alberta. They were covered by mud, buried deeply over the eons, and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of 50 to 150 °C (120 to 300 °F). Due to pressure from the rising of the Rocky Mountains in southwestern Alberta, 80 to 55 million years ago, the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches, thus forming the oil sands.',\n",
       " 'Selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional bitumen to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot bitumen in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in big bags or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags.',\n",
       " 'In British English, the word \\'asphalt\\' is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and asphalt/bitumen (also called tarmac in common parlance). When bitumen is mixed with clay it is usually called asphaltum. The earlier word \\'asphaltum\\' is now archaic and not commonly used.[citation needed] In American English, \\'asphalt\\' is equivalent to the British \\'bitumen\\'. However, \\'asphalt\\' is also commonly used as a shortened form of \\'asphalt concrete\\' (therefore equivalent to the British \\'asphalt\\' or \\'tarmac\\'). In Australian English, bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces. In Canadian English, the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil, while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product used to pave roads and manufacture roof shingles and various waterproofing products. Diluted bitumen (diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines) is known as dilbit in the Canadian petroleum industry, while bitumen \"upgraded\" to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen as synbit. Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum. Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen. The tar sands of Alberta, Canada are a similar material.',\n",
       " \"Bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of Delacroix. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.\",\n",
       " \"In 1914, Claridge's Company entered into a joint venture to produce tar-bound macadam, with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called Clarmac Roads Ltd. Two products resulted, namely Clarmac, and Clarphalte, with the former being manufactured by Clarmac Roads and the latter by Claridge's Patent Asphalte Co., although Clarmac was more widely used.[note 1] However, the First World War impacted financially on the Clarmac Company, which entered into liquidation in 1915. The failure of Clarmac Roads Ltd had a flow-on effect to Claridge's Company, which was itself compulsorily wound up, ceasing operations in 1917, having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture, both at the outset, and in a subsequent attempt to save the Clarmac Company.\",\n",
       " 'The largest use of asphalt/bitumen is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United States. Asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% asphalt/bitumen cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt/bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt/bitumen and the aggregates, but warm-mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required. There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the U.S., and a similar number in Europe.',\n",
       " 'Synthetic crude oil, also known as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada. Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.',\n",
       " 'About 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984[needs update]. It is obtained as the \"heavy\" (i.e., difficult to distill) fraction. Material with a boiling point greater than around 500 °C is considered asphalt. Vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil (such as naphtha, gasoline and diesel). The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications. In a de-asphalting unit, the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules, which are then separated. Further processing is possible by \"blowing\" the product: namely reacting it with oxygen. This step makes the product harder and more viscous.',\n",

The rock asphalt is found in the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction. The bitumen content varies from 83% to 92% (soluble in carbon disulphide), with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point (ring & ball) around 120 °C. The insoluble matter, consisting mainly of silica ore, ranges from 8% to 17%.',\n",

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5 mg/m3 over a 15-minute period. Asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving, roofing, and other applications. In examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined that it is the application parameters, predominantly temperature, that effect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazard/risk of the asphalt emissions. In particular, temperatures greater than 199 °C (390 °F), were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures, such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement.',\n",

       " 'Asphalt/bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as \"oil sands\" in Alberta, Canada, and the similar \"tar sands\" in Utah, US. The Canadian province of Alberta has most of the world\\'s reserves of natural bitumen, in three huge deposits covering 142,000 square kilometres (55,000 sq mi), an area larger than England or New York state. These bituminous sands contain 166 billion barrels (26.4×10^9 m3) of commercially established oil reserves, giving Canada the third largest oil reserves in the world. and produce over 2.3 million barrels per day (370×10^3 m3/d) of heavy crude oil and synthetic crude oil. Although historically it was used without refining to pave roads, nearly all of the bitumen is now used as raw material for oil refineries in Canada and the United States.',\n",
       " 'The first use of asphalt/bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples. On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the Tongva, Luiseño and Chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits. All three used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations. It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water. Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.']"

          "<b>Asphalt</b><br>Asphalt/bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known<br>as \"oil sands\" in Alberta, Canada, and<br>the similar \"tar sands\" in Utah, US.<br>The Canadian province of Alberta has most<br>of the world's reserves of natural bitumen,<br>in three huge deposits covering 142,000 square<br>kilometres (55,000 sq mi), an area larger<br>than England or New York state. These<br>bituminous sands contain 166 billion barrels (26.4×10^9<br>m3) of commercially established oil reserves, giving<br>Canada the third largest oil reserves in<br>the world. and produce over 2.3 million<br>barrels per day (370×10^3 m3/d) of heavy<br>crude oil and synthetic crude oil. Although<br>historically it was used without refining to<br>pave roads, nearly all of the bitumen<br>is now used as raw material for<br>oil refineries in Canada and the United<br>States.",
          "<b>Asphalt</b><br>The first use of asphalt/bitumen in the<br>New World was by indigenous peoples. On<br>the west coast, as early as the<br>13th century, the Tongva, Luiseño and Chumash<br>peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen that<br>seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum<br>deposits. All three used the substance as<br>an adhesive.

          "<b>Post-punk</b><br>The term \"post-punk\" was first used by<br>journalists in the late 1970s to describe<br>groups moving beyond punk's sonic template into<br>disparate areas.

          "<b>Friedrich_Hayek</b><br>Hayek's principal investigations in economics concerned capital,<br>money, and the business cycle. Mises had<br>earlier applied the concept of marginal utility<br>to the value of money in his<br>Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in<br>which he also proposed an explanation for<br>\"industrial fluctuations\" based on the ideas of<br>the old British Currency School and of<br>Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this<br>body of work as a starting point<br>for his own interpretation of the business<br>cycle, elaborating what later became known as<br>the \"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\".<br>Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in<br>more detail in his book, published in<br>1929, an English translation of which appeared<br>in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the<br>Trade Cycle. There he argued for a<br>monetary approach to the origins of the<br>cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931),<br>Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted<br>from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion<br>and its transmission over time, leading to<br>a capital misallocation caused by the artificially<br>low interest rates. Hayek claimed that \"the<br>past instability of the market economy is<br>the consequence of the exclusion of the<br>most important regulator of the market mechanism,<br>money, from itself being regulated by the<br>market process\".",
          "<b>Friedrich_Hayek</b><br>In 1929, Lionel Robbins assumed the helm<br>of the London School of Economics (LSE).<br>Eager to promote alternatives to what he<br>regarded as the narrow approach of the<br>school of economic thought that then dominated<br>the English-speaking academic world (centred at the<br>University of Cambridge and deriving largely from<br>the work of Alfred Marshall), Robbins invited<br>Hayek to join the faculty at LSE,<br>which he did in 1931. According to<br>Nicholas Kaldor, Hayek's theory of the time-structure<br>of capital and of the business cycle<br>initially \"fascinated the academic world\" and appeared<br>to offer a less \"facile and superficial\"<br>understanding of macroeconomics than the Cambridge school's.",
          "<b>Friedrich_Hayek</b><br>Also in 1931, Hayek critiqued Keynes's Treatise<br>on Money (1930) in his \"Reflections on<br>the pure theory of Mr. J. M.<br>Keynes\" and published his lectures at the<br>LSE in book form as Prices and<br>Production. Unemployment and idle resources are, for<br>Keynes, caused by a lack of effective<br>demand; for Hayek, they stem from a<br>previous, unsustainable episode of easy money and<br>artificially low interest rates. Keynes asked his<br>friend Piero Sraffa to respond. Sraffa elaborated<br>on the effect of inflation-induced \"forced savings\"<br>on the capital sector and about the<br>definition of a \"natural\" interest rate in<br>a growing economy. Others who responded negatively<br>to Hayek's work on the business cycle<br>included John Hicks, Frank Knight, and Gunnar<br>Myrdal. Kaldor later wrote that Hayek's Prices<br>and Production had produced \"a remarkable crop<br>of critics\" and that the total number<br>of pages in British and American journals<br>dedicated to the resulting debate \"could rarely<br>have been equalled in the economic controversies<br>of the past.\"",
          "<b>Friedrich_Hayek</b><br>Hayek continued his research on monetary and<br>capital theory, revising his theories of the<br>relations between credit cycles and capital structure<br>in Profits, Interest and Investment (1939) and<br>The Pure Theory of Capital (1941), but<br>his reputation as an economic theorist had<br>by then fallen so much that those<br>works were largely ignored, except for scathing<br>critiques by Nicholas Kaldor. Lionel Robbins himself,<br>who had embraced the Austrian theory of<br>the business cycle in The Great Depression<br>(1934), later regretted having written the book<br>and accepted many of the Keynesian counter-arguments.",

          "<b>Friedrich_Hayek</b><br>Building on the earlier work of Ludwig<br>von Mises and others, Hayek also argued<br>that while in centrally planned economies an<br>individual or a select group of individuals<br>must determine the distribution of resources, these<br>planners will never have enough information to<br>carry out this allocation reliably. This argument,<br>first proposed by Max Weber, says that<br>the efficient exchange and use of resources<br>can be maintained only through the price<br>mechanism in free markets (see economic calculation<br>problem).",
          "<b>Friedrich_Hayek</b><br>Some socialists such as H. D. Dickinson<br>and Oskar Lange, responded by invoking general<br>equilibrium theory, which they argued disproved Mises's<br>thesis. They noted that the difference between<br>a planned and a free market system<br>lay in who was responsible for solving<br>the equations. They argued, if some of<br>the prices chosen by socialist managers were<br>wrong, gluts or shortages would appear, signalling<br>them to adjust the prices up or<br>down, just as in a free market.<br>Through such a trial and error, a<br>socialist economy could mimic the efficiency of<br>a free market system, while avoiding its<br>many problems.",
          "<b>Friedrich_Hayek</b><br>In The Use of Knowledge in Society<br>(1945), Hayek argued that the price mechanism<br>serves to share and synchronise local and<br>personal knowledge, allowing society's members to achieve<br>diverse, complicated ends through a principle of<br>spontaneous self-organization.

These ideas were informed by<br>a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns<br>regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge.<br>Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic, free-market<br>polity would be self-regulating to such a<br>degree that it would be 'a society<br>which does not depend for its functioning<br>on our finding good men for running<br>it'.",

          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Lee has said that To Kill a<br>Mockingbird is not an autobiography, but rather<br>an example of how an author \"should<br>write about what he knows and write<br>truthfully\". Nevertheless, several people and events from<br>Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional<br>Scout. Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was<br>an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and<br>in 1919, he defended two black men<br>accused of murder.

Lee's mother was prone<br>to a nervous condition that rendered her<br>mentally and emotionally absent. Lee had a<br>brother named Edwin, who—like the fictional Jem—was<br>four years older than his sister. As<br>in the novel, a black housekeeper came<br>daily to care for the Lee house<br>and family.",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Lee modeled the character of Dill on<br>her childhood friend, Truman Capote, known then<br>as Truman Persons. Just as Dill lived<br>next door to Scout during the summer,<br>Capote lived next door to Lee with<br>his aunts while his mother visited New<br>York City. Like Dill, Capote had an<br>impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating<br>stories. Both Lee and Capote were atypical<br>children: both loved to read. Lee was<br>a scrappy tomboy who was quick to<br>fight, but Capote was ridiculed for his<br>advanced vocabulary and lisp.

They became good friends<br>when both felt alienated from their peers;<br>Capote called the two of them \"apart<br>people\". In 1960, Capote and Lee traveled<br>to Kansas together to investigate the multiple<br>murders that were the basis for Capote's<br>nonfiction novel In Cold Blood.",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>The origin of Tom Robinson is less<br>clear, although many have speculated that his<br>character was inspired by several models. When<br>Lee was 10 years old, a white<br>woman near Monroeville accused a black man<br>named Walter Lett of raping her. The<br>story and the trial were covered by<br>her father's newspaper which reported that Lett<br>was convicted and sentenced to death. After<br>a series of letters appeared claiming Lett<br>had been falsely accused, his sentence was<br>commuted to life in prison. He died<br>there of tuberculosis in 1937. Scholars believe<br>that Robinson's difficulties reflect the notorious case<br>of the Scottsboro Boys, in which nine<br>black men were convicted of raping two<br>white women on negligible evidence. However, in<br>2005, Lee stated that she had in<br>mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro<br>case served \"the same purpose\" to display<br>Southern prejudices. Emmett Till, a black teenager<br>who was murdered for flirting with a<br>white woman in Mississippi in 1955, and<br>whose death is credited as a catalyst<br>for the Civil Rights Movement, is also<br>considered a model for Tom Robinson.",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Writing about Lee's style and use of<br>humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline<br>Tavernier-Courbin states: \"Laughter ... [exposes] the gangrene<br>under the beautiful surface but also by<br>demeaning it; one can hardly ... be<br>controlled by what one is able to<br>laugh at.\" Scout's precocious observations about her<br>neighbors and behavior inspire National Endowment of<br>the Arts director David Kipen to call<br>her \"hysterically funny\". To address complex issues,<br>however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody,<br>satire, and irony effectively by using a<br>child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry<br>her, then spends too much time with<br>Jem, Scout reasons the best way to<br>get him to pay attention to her<br>is to beat him up, which she<br>does several times. Scout's first day in<br>school is a satirical treatment of education;<br>her teacher says she must undo the<br>damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her<br>to read and write, and forbids Atticus<br>from teaching her further. Lee treats the<br>most unfunny situations with irony, however, as<br>Jem and Scout try to understand how<br>Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely<br>to remain a decent society. Satire and<br>irony are used to such an extent<br>that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the<br>book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of<br>education, the justice system, and her own<br>society by using them as subjects of<br>her humorous disapproval.",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Critics also note the entertaining methods used<br>to drive the plot. When Atticus is<br>out of town, Jem locks a Sunday<br>school classmate in the church basement with<br>the furnace during a game of Shadrach.<br>This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to<br>escort Scout and Jem to her church,<br>which allows the children a glimpse into<br>her personal life, as well as Tom<br>Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween<br>pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage,<br>causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She<br>is so distracted and embarrassed that she<br>prefers to go home in her ham<br>costume, which saves her life.",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Scholars have characterized To Kill a Mockingbird<br>as both a Southern Gothic and coming-of-age<br>or Bildungsroman novel. The grotesque and near-supernatural<br>qualities of Boo Radley and his house,<br>and the element of racial injustice involving<br>Tom Robinson contribute to the aura of<br>the Gothic in the novel. Lee used<br>the term \"Gothic\" to describe the architecture<br>of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to<br>Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley.<br>Outsiders are also an important element of<br>Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's<br>questions about the hierarchy in the town<br>cause scholars to compare the novel to<br>Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of<br>Huckleberry Finn. Despite challenging the town's systems,<br>Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above<br>all others, because he believes that following<br>one's conscience is the highest priority, even<br>when the result is social ostracism. However,<br>scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification,<br>noting that Boo Radley is in fact<br>human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing<br>themes such as alcoholism, incest, rape, and<br>racial violence, Lee wrote about her small<br>town realistically rather than melodramatically. She portrays<br>the problems of individual characters as universal<br>underlying issues in every society.",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>As children coming of age, Scout and<br>Jem face hard realities and learn from<br>them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense<br>of loss about how his neighbors have<br>disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says<br>to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day<br>after the trial, \"It's like bein' a<br>caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon ... I<br>always thought Maycomb folks were the best<br>folks in the world, least that's what<br>they seemed like\". This leads him to<br>struggle with understanding the separations of race<br>and class. Just as the novel is<br>an illustration of the changes Jem faces,<br>it is also an exploration of the<br>realities Scout must face as an atypical<br>girl on the verge of womanhood. As<br>one scholar writes, \"To Kill a Mockingbird<br>can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman,<br>for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences<br>with a clear sense of her place<br>in her community and an awareness of<br>her potential power as the woman she<br>will one day be.\"",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>The second part of the novel deals<br>with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed<br>\"the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white<br>Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\".<br>In the years following its release, many<br>reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a<br>novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia<br>Durst Johnson considers it \"reasonable to believe\"<br>that the novel was shaped by two<br>events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa<br>Parks' refusal to yield her seat on<br>a city bus to a white person,<br>which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott,<br>and the 1956 riots at the University<br>of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly<br>Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her<br>application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated<br>in 1980). In writing about the historical<br>context of the novel's construction, two other<br>literary scholars remark: \"To Kill a Mockingbird<br>was written and published amidst the most<br>significant and conflict-ridden social change in the<br>South since the Civil War and Reconstruction.<br>Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story<br>told from the perspective of the 1950s<br>voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced<br>by this transition.\"",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggests Emmett Till<br>was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates<br>the injustices endured by the fictional Tom<br>that Till also faced. Chura notes the<br>icon of the black rapist causing harm<br>to the representation of the \"mythologized vulnerable<br>and sacred Southern womanhood\". Any transgressions by<br>black males that merely hinted at sexual<br>contact with white females during the time<br>the novel was set often resulted in<br>a punishment of death for the accused.<br>Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor<br>white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming<br>evidence of his innocence, as more educated<br>and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's<br>decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice<br>in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically<br>impaired, which made him unable to commit<br>the act he was accused of, but<br>also crippled him in other ways. Roslyn<br>Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example<br>of the recurring motif among white Southern<br>writers of the black man as \"stupid,<br>pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair<br>dealing of the whites, rather than his<br>own intelligence to save him\". Although Tom<br>is spared from being lynched, he is<br>killed with excessive violence during an attempted<br>escape from prison, shot seventeen times.",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>The theme of racial injustice appears symbolically<br>in the novel as well. For example,<br>Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even<br>though it is not his job to<br>do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the<br>dog represents prejudice within the town of<br>Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a<br>deserted street to shoot the dog, must<br>fight against the town's racism without help<br>from other white citizens. He is also<br>alone when he faces a group intending<br>to lynch Tom Robinson and once more<br>in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee<br>even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad<br>dog incident to describe some of the<br>courtroom scenes. Jones writes, \"[t]he real mad<br>dog in Maycomb is the racism that<br>denies the humanity of Tom Robinson ....<br>When Atticus makes his summation to the<br>jury, he literally bares himself to the<br>jury's and the town's anger.\"",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that<br>her aspiration was \"to be ... the<br>Jane Austen of South Alabama.\" Both Austen<br>and Lee challenged the social status quo<br>and valued individual worth over social standing.<br>When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter<br>Cunningham, at the Finch home one day,<br>Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes<br>her for doing so. Atticus respects Calpurnia's<br>judgment, and later in the book even<br>stands up to his sister, the formidable<br>Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they<br>fire Calpurnia. One writer notes that Scout,<br>\"in Austenian fashion\", satirizes women with whom<br>she does not wish to identify. Literary<br>critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared<br>by the two authors: \"affirmation of order<br>in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for<br>the individual without regard for status\".",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Scholars argue that Lee's approach to class<br>and race was more complex \"than ascribing<br>racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash'<br>... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender<br>and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices<br>that might challenge the existing order, and<br>greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the<br>causes of racism and segregation.\" Lee's use<br>of the middle-class narrative voice is a<br>literary device that allows an intimacy with<br>the reader, regardless of class or cultural<br>background, and fosters a sense of nostalgia.<br>Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader<br>is allowed to engage in relationships with<br>the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class<br>Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally<br>poor but behave in vastly different ways;<br>the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond;<br>and Calpurnia and other members of the<br>black community.

          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>The novel has been noted for its<br>poignant exploration of different forms of courage.<br>Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who<br>insult Atticus reflects her attempt to stand<br>up for him and defend him. Atticus<br>is the moral center of the novel,<br>however, and he teaches Jem one of<br>the most significant lessons of courage. In<br>a statement that foreshadows Atticus' motivation for<br>defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose,<br>who is determined to break herself of<br>a morphine addiction, Atticus tells Jem that<br>courage is \"when you're licked before you<br>begin but you begin anyway and you<br>see it through no matter what\".",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Charles Shields, who has written the only<br>book-length biography of Harper Lee to date,<br>offers the reason for the novel's enduring<br>popularity and impact is that \"its lessons<br>of human dignity and respect for others<br>remain fundamental and universal\". Atticus' lesson to<br>Scout that \"you never really understand a<br>person until you consider things from his<br>point of view—until you climb around in<br>his skin and walk around in it\"<br>exemplifies his compassion. She ponders the comment<br>when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony.

Scout's primary identification with her father<br>and older brother allows her to describe<br>the variety and depth of female characters<br>in the novel both as one of<br>them and as an outsider. Scout's primary<br>female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor<br>Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong<br>willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also<br>has an influence; Scout watches her destroy<br>an innocent man in order to hide<br>her desire for him. The female characters<br>who comment the most on Scout's lack<br>of willingness to adhere to a more<br>feminine role are also those who promote<br>the most racist and classist points of<br>view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout<br>for not wearing a dress and camisole,<br>and indicates she is ruining the family<br>name by not doing so, in addition<br>to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom<br>Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of<br>Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences<br>of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar<br>writes, \"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is<br>becoming a feminist in the South, for<br>with the use of first-person narration, she<br>indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains<br>the ambivalence about being a Southern lady<br>she possessed as a child.\"",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another<br>theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's<br>mother died before Scout could remember her,<br>Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley<br>is silent about Boo's confinement to the<br>house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described<br>are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted,<br>molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons<br>his son in his house until Boo<br>is remembered only as a phantom. Bob<br>Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form<br>of masculinity that Atticus does not, and<br>the novel suggests that such men as<br>well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at<br>the Missionary Society can lead society astray.<br>Atticus stands apart as a unique model<br>of masculinity; as one scholar explains: \"It<br>is the job of real men who<br>embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic<br>individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of<br>and dedication to social justice and morality,<br>to set the society straight.\"",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Allusions to legal issues in To Kill<br>a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of<br>the courtroom, has drawn the attention from<br>legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that<br>\"a greater volume of critical readings has<br>been amassed by two legal scholars in<br>law journals than by all the literary<br>scholars in literary journals\". The opening quote<br>by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads:<br>\"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson<br>notes that even in Scout and Jem's<br>childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck<br>with each other by spitting on one's<br>palm and laws are discussed by Atticus<br>and his children: is it right that<br>Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of<br>season? Many social codes are broken by<br>people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond<br>has been exiled by society for taking<br>a black woman as his common-law wife<br>and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is<br>beaten by her father in punishment for<br>kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into<br>a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment<br>far greater than any court could have<br>given him. Scout repeatedly breaks codes and<br>laws and reacts to her punishment for<br>them. For example, she refuses to wear<br>frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's \"fanatical\"<br>attempts to place her in them made<br>her feel \"a pink cotton penitentiary closing<br>in on [her]\". Johnson states, \"[t]he novel<br>is a study of how Jem and<br>Scout begin to perceive the complexity of<br>social codes and how the configuration of<br>relationships dictated by or set off by<br>those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants<br>of (their) small worlds.\"",

          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some lamented<br>the use of poor white Southerners, and<br>one-dimensional black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled<br>the book \"melodramatic and contrived\". When the<br>book was first released, Southern writer Flannery<br>O'Connor commented, \"I think for a child's<br>book it does all right. It's interesting<br>that all the folks that are buying<br>it don't know they're reading a child's<br>book.

          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>The 50th anniversary of the novel's release<br>was met with celebrations and reflections on<br>its impact. Eric Zorn of the Chicago<br>Tribune praises Lee's \"rich use of language\"<br>but writes that the central lesson is<br>that \"courage isn't always flashy, isn't always<br>enough, but is always in style\". Jane<br>Sullivan in the Sydney Morning Herald agrees,<br>stating that the book \"still rouses fresh<br>and horrified indignation\" as it examines morality,<br>a topic that has recently become unfashionable.<br>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in The Guardian<br>states that Lee, rare among American novelists,<br>writes with \"a fiercely progressive ink, in<br>which there is nothing inevitable about racism<br>and its very foundation is open to<br>question\", comparing her to William Faulkner, who<br>wrote about racism as an inevitability. Literary<br>critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland's The Herald<br>notes the connections between Lee and Jane<br>Austen, stating the book's central theme, that<br>\"one’s moral convictions are worth fighting for,<br>even at the risk of being reviled\"<br>is eloquently discussed.",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Native Alabamian Allen Barra sharply criticized Lee<br>and the novel in The Wall Street<br>Journal calling Atticus a \"repository of cracker-barrel<br>epigrams\" and the novel represents a \"sugar-coated<br>myth\" of Alabama history. Barra writes, \"It's<br>time to stop pretending that To Kill<br>a Mockingbird is some kind of timeless<br>classic that ranks with the great works<br>of American literature. Its bloodless liberal humanism<br>is sadly dated\". Thomas Mallon in The<br>New Yorker criticizes Atticus' stiff and self-righteous<br>demeanor, and calls Scout \"a kind of<br>highly constructed doll\" whose speech and actions<br>are improbable. Although acknowledging that the novel<br>works, Mallon blasts Lee's \"wildly unstable\" narrative<br>voice for developing a story about a<br>content neighborhood until it begins to impart<br>morals in the courtroom drama, following with<br>his observation that \"the book has begun<br>to cherish its own goodness\" by the<br>time the case is over.[note 2] Defending<br>the book, Akin Ajayi writes that justice<br>\"is often complicated, but must always be<br>founded upon the notion of equality and<br>fairness for all.\" Ajayi states that the<br>book forces readers to question issues about<br>race, class, and society, but that it<br>was not written to resolve them.",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Furthermore, despite the novel's thematic focus on<br>racial injustice, its black characters are not<br>fully examined. In its use of racial<br>epithets, stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks, and<br>Calpurnia, who to some critics is an<br>updated version of the \"contented slave\" motif<br>and to others simply unexplored, the book<br>is viewed as marginalizing black characters. One<br>writer asserts that the use of Scout's<br>narration serves as a convenient mechanism for<br>readers to be innocent and detached from<br>the racial conflict. Scout's voice \"functions as<br>the not-me which allows the rest of<br>us—black and white, male and female—to find<br>our relative position in society\". A teaching<br>guide for the novel published by The<br>English Journal cautions, \"what seems wonderful or<br>powerful to one group of students may<br>seem degrading to another\". A Canadian language<br>arts consultant found that the novel resonated<br>well with white students, but that black<br>students found it \"demoralizing\". Another criticism, articulated<br>by Michael Lind, is that the novel<br>indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of<br>poor rural \"white trash\".",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the<br>Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To<br>Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of<br>racists, and states that every child in<br>the South has moments of racial cognitive<br>dissonance when they are faced with the<br>harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes<br>them to question the beliefs with which<br>they have been raised, which for many<br>children is what the novel does. McWhorter<br>writes of Lee, \"for a white person<br>from the South to write a book<br>like this in the late 1950s is<br>really unusual—by its very existence an act<br>of protest.\"[note 4] Author James McBride calls<br>Lee brilliant but stops short of calling<br>her brave: \"I think by calling Harper<br>Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself<br>of your own racism ... She certainly<br>set the standards in terms of how<br>these issues need to be discussed, but<br>in many ways I feel ... the<br>moral bar's been lowered. And that's really<br>distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches.\"<br>McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and<br>the way Lee approaches the story with<br>\"honesty and integrity\".",
          "<b>To_Kill_a_Mockingbird</b><br>According to a National Geographic article, the<br>novel is so revered in Monroeville that<br>people quote lines from it like Scripture;<br>yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend<br>any performances, because \"she abhors anything that<br>trades on the book's fame\". To underscore<br>this sentiment, Lee demanded that a book<br>of recipes named Calpurnia's Cookbook not be<br>published and sold out of the Monroe<br>County Heritage Museum. David Lister in The<br>Independent states that Lee's refusal to speak<br>to reporters made them desire to interview<br>her all the more, and her silence<br>\"makes Bob Dylan look like a media<br>tart\". Despite her discouragement, a rising number<br>of tourists made to Monroeville a destination,<br>hoping to see Lee's inspiration for the<br>book, or Lee herself.

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>From 7 September 1940, one year into<br>the war, London was bombed by the<br>Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights.

The eight months of bombing never<br>seriously hampered British production and the war<br>industries continued to operate and expand. The<br>Blitz was only authorised when the Luftwaffe<br>had failed to meet preconditions for a<br>1940 launch of Operation Sea Lion, the<br>provisionally planned German invasion of Britain. By<br>May 1941 the threat of an invasion<br>of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention<br>had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the<br>East. In comparison to the later Allied<br>bombing campaign against Germany, the Blitz resulted<br>in relatively few casualties; the British bombing<br>of Hamburg in July 1943 inflicted some<br>42,000 civilian deaths, about the same as<br>the entire Blitz.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>In the 1920s and 1930s, air power<br>theorists Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell espoused<br>the idea that air forces could win<br>wars by themselves, without a need for<br>land and sea fighting. It was thought<br>there was no defence against air attack,<br>particularly at night. Enemy industry, their seats<br>of government, factories and communications could be<br>destroyed, effectively taking away their means to<br>resist. It was also thought the bombing<br>of residential centres would cause a collapse<br>of civilian will, which might have led<br>to the collapse of production and civil<br>life. Democracies, where the populace was allowed<br>to show overt disapproval of the ruling<br>government, were thought particularly vulnerable. This thinking<br>was prevalent in both the RAF and<br>what was then known as the United<br>States Army Air Corps (USAAC) between the<br>two world wars. RAF Bomber Command's policy<br>in particular would attempt to achieve victory<br>through the destruction of civilian will, communications<br>and industry.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Within the Luftwaffe, there was a more<br>muted view of strategic bombing. The OKL<br>did not oppose the strategic bombardment of<br>enemy industries and or cities, and believed<br>it could greatly affect the balance of<br>power on the battlefield in Germany's favour<br>by disrupting production and damaging civilian morale,<br>but they did not believe that air<br>power alone could be decisive. Contrary to<br>popular belief, the Luftwaffe did not have<br>a systematic policy of what became known<br>as \"terror bombing\". Evidence suggests that the<br>Luftwaffe did not adopt an official bombing<br>policy in which civilians became the primary<br>target until 1942.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Wever argued that the Luftwaffe General Staff<br>should not be solely educated in tactical<br>and operational matters. He argued they should<br>be educated in grand strategy, war economics,<br>armament production, and the mentality of potential<br>opponents (also known as mirror imaging). Wever's<br>vision was not realised; the General Staff<br>studies in those subjects fell by the<br>wayside, and the Air Academies focused on<br>tactics, technology, and operational planning, rather than<br>on independent strategic air offensives.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>In 1936, Wever was killed in an<br>air crash. The failure to implement his<br>vision for the new Luftwaffe was largely<br>attributable to his immediate successors. Ex-Army personnel<br>Albert Kesselring and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff are usually<br>blamed for the turning away from strategic<br>planning and focusing on close air support.<br>However, it would seem the two most<br>prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support<br>operations (direct or indirect) were actually Hugo<br>Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek. These men were<br>long-time professional airmen involved in German air<br>services since early in their careers. The<br>Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support<br>operations because of pressure from the army,<br>or because it was led by ex-army<br>personnel. It was instead a mission that<br>suited the Luftwaffe's existing approach to warfare;<br>a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather<br>than independent strategic air campaigns.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Adolf Hitler failed to pay as much<br>attention to bombing the enemy as he<br>did to protection from enemy bombing, although<br>he had promoted the development of a<br>bomber force in the 1930s and understood<br>that it was possible to use bombers<br>for major strategic purposes. He told the<br>OKL in 1939 that ruthless employment of<br>the Luftwaffe against the heart of the<br>British will to resist could and would<br>follow when the moment was right; however,<br>he quickly developed a lively scepticism toward<br>strategic bombing, confirmed by the results of<br>the Blitz. He frequently complained of the<br>Luftwaffe's inability to damage industries sufficiently, saying,<br>\"The munitions industry cannot be interfered with<br>effectively by air raids ... usually the<br>prescribed targets are not hit\".",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Ultimately, Hitler was trapped within his own<br>vision of bombing as a terror weapon,<br>formed in the 1930s when he threatened<br>smaller nations into accepting German rule rather<br>than submit to air bombardment. This fact<br>had important implications. It showed the extent<br>to which Hitler personally mistook Allied strategy<br>for one of morale breaking instead of<br>one of economic warfare, with the collapse<br>of morale as an additional bonus. Hitler<br>was much more attracted to the political<br>aspects of bombing. As the mere threat<br>of it had produced diplomatic results in<br>the 1930s, he expected that the threat<br>of German retaliation would persuade the Allies<br>to adopt a policy of moderation and<br>not to begin a policy of unrestricted<br>bombing. His hope was — for reasons<br>of political prestige within Germany itself —<br>that the German population would be protected<br>from the Allied bombings. When this proved<br>impossible, he began to fear that popular<br>feeling would turn against his regime, and<br>he redoubled efforts to mount a similar<br>\"terror offensive\" against Britain in order to<br>produce a stalemate in which both sides<br>would hesitate to use bombing at all.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>A major problem in the managing of<br>the Luftwaffe was Hermann Göring. Hitler believed<br>the Luftwaffe was \"the most effective strategic<br>weapon\", and in reply to repeated requests<br>from the Kriegsmarine for control over aircraft<br>insisted, \"We should never have been able<br>to hold our own in this war<br>if we had not had an undivided<br>Luftwaffe\". Such principles made it much harder<br>to integrate the air force into the<br>overall strategy and produced in Göring a<br>jealous and damaging defence of his \"empire\"<br>while removing Hitler voluntarily from the systematic<br>direction of the Luftwaffe at either the<br>strategic or operational level. When Hitler tried<br>to intervene more in the running of<br>the air force later in the war,<br>he was faced with a political conflict<br>of his own making between himself and<br>Göring, which was not fully resolved until<br>the war was almost over. In 1940<br>and 1941, Göring's refusal to cooperate with<br>the Kriegsmarine denied the entire Wehrmacht military<br>forces of the Reich the chance to<br>strangle British sea communications, which might have<br>had strategic or decisive effect in the<br>war against the British Empire.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>The deliberate separation of the Luftwaffe from<br>the rest of the military structure encouraged<br>the emergence of a major \"communications gap\"<br>between Hitler and the Luftwaffe, which other<br>factors helped to exacerbate.

When Göring<br>decided against continuing Wever's original heavy bomber<br>programme in 1937, the Reichsmarschall's own explanation<br>was that Hitler wanted to know only<br>how many bombers there were, not how<br>many engines each had. In July 1939,<br>Göring arranged a display of the Luftwaffe's<br>most advanced equipment at Rechlin, to give<br>the impression the air force was more<br>prepared for a strategic air war than<br>was actually the case.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Within hours of the UK and France<br>declaring war on Germany on 3 September<br>1939, the RAF bombed German warships along<br>the German coast at Wilhelmshaven. Thereafter bombing<br>operations were against ports and shipping and<br>propaganda leaflet drops. Operations were planned to<br>minimize civilian casualties. From 15 May 1940<br>– the day after the Luftwaffe destroyed<br>the centre of Rotterdam – the RAF<br>also carried out operations east of the<br>Rhine, attacking industrial and transportation targets.

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Although not specifically prepared to conduct independent<br>strategic air operations against an opponent, the<br>Luftwaffe was expected to do so over<br>Britain. From July until September 1940 the<br>Luftwaffe attacked RAF Fighter Command to gain<br>air superiority as a prelude to invasion.<br>This involved the bombing of English Channel<br>convoys, ports, and RAF airfields and supporting<br>industries. Destroying RAF Fighter Command would allow<br>the Germans to gain control of the<br>skies over the invasion area. It was<br>supposed that Bomber Command, RAF Coastal Command<br>and the Royal Navy could not operate<br>under conditions of German air superiority.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>The Luftwaffe's poor intelligence meant that their<br>aircraft were not always able to locate<br>their targets, and thus attacks on factories<br>and airfields failed to achieve the desired<br>results. British fighter aircraft production continued at<br>a rate surpassing Germany's by 2 to<br>1. The British produced 10,000 aircraft in<br>1940, in comparison to Germany's 8,000. The<br>replacement of pilots and aircrew was more<br>difficult. Both the RAF and Luftwaffe struggled<br>to replace manpower losses, though the Germans<br>had larger reserves of trained aircrew. The<br>circumstances affected the Germans more than the<br>British. Operating over home territory, British flyers<br>could fly again if they survived being<br>shot down. German crews, even if they<br>survived, faced capture. Moreover, bombers had four<br>to five crewmen on board, representing a<br>greater loss of manpower. On 7 September,<br>the Germans shifted away from the destruction<br>of the RAF's supporting structures. German intelligence<br>suggested Fighter Command was weakening, and an<br>attack on London would force it into<br>a final battle of annihilation while compelling<br>the British Government to surrender.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>The decision to change strategy is sometimes<br>claimed as a major mistake by the<br>Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL).

Others argue that the Luftwaffe made<br>little impression on Fighter Command in the<br>last week of August and first week<br>of September and that the shift in<br>strategy was not decisive. It has also<br>been argued that it was doubtful the<br>Luftwaffe could have won air superiority before<br>the \"weather window\" began to deteriorate in<br>October. It was also possible, if RAF<br>losses became severe, that they could pull<br>out to the north, wait for the<br>German invasion, then redeploy southward again. Other<br>historians argue that the outcome of the<br>air battle was irrelevant; the massive numerical<br>superiority of British naval forces and the<br>inherent weakness of the Kriegsmarine would have<br>made the projected German invasion, Unternehmen Seelöwe<br>(Operation Sea Lion), a disaster with or<br>without German air superiority.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Regardless of the ability of the Luftwaffe<br>to win air superiority, Adolf Hitler was<br>frustrated that it was not happening quickly<br>enough. With no sign of the RAF<br>weakening, and Luftwaffe air fleets (Luftflotten) taking<br>punishing losses, the OKL was keen for<br>a change in strategy. To reduce losses<br>further, a change in strategy was also<br>favoured to take place at night, to<br>give the bombers greater protection under cover<br>of darkness.[b] On 4 September 1940, in<br>a long address at the Sportspalast, Hitler<br>declared: \"And should the Royal Air Force<br>drop two thousand, or three thousand [kilograms<br>...] then we will now drop [...]<br>300,000, 400,000, yes one million kilograms in<br>a single night.

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>It was decided to focus on bombing<br>Britain's industrial cities in daylight to begin<br>with. The main focus of the bombing<br>operations was against the city of London.<br>The first major raid in this regard<br>took place on 7 September. On 15<br>September, on a date known as the<br>Battle of Britain Day, a large-scale raid<br>was launched in daylight, but suffered significant<br>loss for no lasting gain. Although there<br>were a few large air battles fought<br>in daylight later in the month and<br>into October, the Luftwaffe switched its main<br>effort to night attacks in order to<br>reduce losses. This became official policy on<br>7 October. The air campaign soon got<br>underway against London and other British cities.<br>However, the Luftwaffe faced limitations. Its aircraft—Dornier<br>Do 17, Junkers Ju 88, and Heinkel<br>He 111s—were capable of carrying out strategic<br>missions, but were incapable of doing greater<br>damage because of bomb-load limitations. The Luftwaffe's<br>decision in the interwar period to concentrate<br>on medium bombers can be attributed to<br>several reasons: Hitler did not intend or<br>foresee a war with Britain in 1939;<br>the OKL believed a medium bomber could<br>carry out strategic missions just as well<br>as a heavy bomber force; and Germany<br>did not possess the resources or technical<br>ability to produce four-engined bombers before the<br>war.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Although it had equipment capable of doing<br>serious damage, the problem for the Luftwaffe<br>was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence.<br>OKL had not been informed that Britain<br>was to be considered a potential opponent<br>until early 1938. It had no time<br>to gather reliable intelligence on Britain's industries.<br>Moreover, OKL could not settle on an<br>appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide<br>whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight<br>of its attacks against a specific segment<br>of British industry such as aircraft factories,<br>or against a system of interrelated industries<br>such as Britain's import and distribution network,<br>or even in a blow aimed at<br>breaking the morale of the British population.<br>The Luftwaffe's strategy became increasingly aimless over<br>the winter of 1940–1941.

However, the use of delayed-action<br>bombs, while initially very effective, gradually had<br>less impact, partly because they failed to<br>detonate.[c] Moreover, the British had anticipated the<br>change in strategy and dispersed its production<br>facilities making them less vulnerable to a<br>concentrated attack. Regional commissioners were given plenipotentiary<br>powers to restore communications and organise the<br>distribution of supplies to keep the war<br>economy moving.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Based on experience with German strategic bombing<br>during World War I against the United<br>Kingdom, the British government estimated after the<br>war that 50 casualties— with about one<br>third killed— would result for every tonne<br>of bombs dropped on London. The estimate<br>of tonnes of bombs an enemy could<br>drop per day grew as aircraft technology<br>advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150<br>in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That<br>year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated<br>that an attack of 60 days would<br>result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded.<br>News reports of the Spanish Civil War,<br>such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported<br>the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally<br>expected that Germany would attempt to drop<br>as much as 3,500 tonnes in the<br>first 24 hours of war and average<br>700 tonnes a day for several weeks.<br>In addition to high explosive and incendiary<br>bombs the enemy would possibly use poison<br>gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with<br>a high degree of accuracy.

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>British air doctrine, since the time of<br>Chief of the Air Staff Hugh Trenchard<br>in the early 1920s, had stressed offence<br>was the best means of defence. British<br>defensive strategy revolved around offensive action, what<br>became known as the cult of the<br>offensive. To prevent German formations from hitting<br>targets in Britain, RAF's Bomber Command would<br>destroy Luftwaffe aircraft on their own bases,<br>aircraft in their factories and fuel reserves<br>by attacking oil plants. This philosophy was<br>impractical as Bomber Command lacked the technology<br>and equipment and needed several years to<br>develop it.

Transmitters on<br>the ground sent pulses at a rate<br>of 180 per minute. X-Gerät received and<br>analysed the pulses, giving the pilot both<br>visual and aural \"on course\" signals. Three<br>beams intersected the beam along the He<br>111's flight path.

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>German beacons operated on the medium-frequency band<br>and the signals involved a two-letter Morse<br>identifier followed by a lengthy time-lapse which<br>enabled the Luftwaffe crews to determine the<br>signal's bearing. The Meacon system involved separate<br>locations for a receiver with a directional<br>aerial and a transmitter. The receipt of<br>the German signal by the receiver was<br>duly passed to the transmitter, the signal<br>to be repeated. The action did not<br>guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber<br>flew closer to its own beam than<br>the Meacon then the former signal would<br>come through the stronger on the direction<br>finder. The reverse would apply only if<br>the meacon were closer.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>In general, German bombers were likely to<br>get through to their targets without too<br>much difficulty. It was to be some<br>months before an effective night fighter force<br>would be ready, and anti-aircraft defences only<br>became adequate after the Blitz was over,<br>so ruses were created to lure German<br>bombers away from their targets. Throughout 1940,<br>dummy airfields were prepared, good enough to<br>stand up to skilled observation. A number[clarification<br>needed] of bombs fell on these diversionary<br>(\"Starfish\") targets.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>The use of diversionary techniques such as<br>fires had to be made carefully. The<br>fake fires could only begin when the<br>bombing started over an adjacent target and<br>its effects were brought under control. Too<br>early and the chances of success receded;<br>too late and the real conflagration at<br>the target would exceed the diversionary fires.<br>Another innovation was the boiler fire. These<br>units were fed from two adjacent tanks<br>containing oil and water. The oil-fed fires<br>were then injected with water from time<br>to time; the flashes produced were similar<br>to those of the German C-250 and<br>C-500 Flammbomben. The hope was that, if<br>it could deceive German bombardiers, it would<br>draw more bombers away from the real<br>target.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Initially the change in strategy caught the<br>RAF off-guard, and caused extensive damage and<br>civilian casualties.

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>The American observer Ingersoll reported at this<br>time that \"as to the accuracy of<br>the bombing of military objectives, here I<br>make no qualifications. The aim is surprisingly,<br>astonishingly, amazingly inaccurate ... The physical damage<br>to civilian London, to sum up, was<br>more general and more extensive than I<br>had imagined. The damage to military targets<br>much less\", and stated that he had<br>seen numerous examples of untouched targets surrounded<br>by buildings destroyed by errant bombs. For<br>example, in two months of bombing, Battersea<br>Power Station, perhaps the largest single target<br>in London, had only received one minor<br>hit (\"a nick\"). No bridge over the<br>Thames had been hit, and the docks<br>were still functioning despite great damage. An<br>airfield was hit 56 times but the<br>runways were never damaged and the field<br>was never out of operation, despite German<br>pilots' familiarity with it from prewar commercial<br>flights. Ingersoll wrote that the difference between<br>the failure of the German campaign against<br>military targets versus its success in continental<br>Europe was the RAF retaining control of<br>the air.:79–80,174",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>British night air defences were in a<br>poor state. Few anti-aircraft guns had fire-control<br>systems, and the underpowered searchlights were usually<br>ineffective against aircraft at altitudes above 12,000<br>ft (3,700 m). In July 1940, only<br>1,200 heavy and 549 light guns were<br>deployed in the whole of Britain. Of<br>the \"heavies\", some 200 were of the<br>obsolescent 3 in (76 mm) type; the<br>remainder were the effective 4.5 in (110<br>mm) and 3.7 in (94 mm) guns,<br>with a theoretical \"ceiling\"' of over 30,000<br>ft (9,100 m) but a practical limit<br>of 25,000 ft (7,600 m) because the<br>predictor in use could not accept greater<br>heights. The light guns, about half of<br>which were of the excellent Bofors 40<br>mm, dealt with aircraft only up to<br>6,000 ft (1,800 m). Although the use<br>of the guns improved civilian morale, with<br>the knowledge the German bomber crews were<br>facing the barrage, it is now believed<br>that the anti-aircraft guns achieved little and<br>in fact the falling shell fragments caused<br>more British casualties on the ground.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>London's defences were rapidly reorganised by General<br>Pile, the Commander-in-Chief of Anti-Aircraft Command. The<br>difference this made to the effectiveness of<br>air defences is questionable. The British were<br>still one-third below the establishment of heavy<br>anti-aircraft artillery AAA (or ack-ack) in May<br>1941, with only 2,631 weapons available. Dowding<br>had to rely on night fighters. From<br>1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter<br>was the Boulton Paul Defiant; its four<br>squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than<br>any other type. AA defences improved by<br>better use of radar and searchlights. Over<br>several months, the 20,000 shells spent per<br>raider shot down in September 1940, was<br>reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and<br>to 2,963 shells in February 1941.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Airborne Interception radar (AI) was unreliable.

Of greater potential was<br>the GL (Gunlaying) radar and searchlights with<br>fighter direction from RAF fighter control rooms<br>to begin a GCI system (Ground Control-led<br>Interception) under Group-level control (No. 10 Group<br>RAF, No. 11 Group RAF and No.<br>12 Group RAF).",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Whitehall's disquiet at the failures of the<br>RAF led to the replacement of Dowding<br>(who was already due for retirement) with<br>Sholto Douglas on 25 November. Douglas set<br>about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the<br>few GL sets to create a carpet<br>effect in the southern counties. Still, in<br>February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons<br>with 87 pilots, under half the required<br>strength. The GL carpet was supported by<br>six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By<br>the height of the Blitz, they were<br>becoming more successful. The number of contacts<br>and combats rose in 1941, from 44<br>and two in 48 sorties in January<br>1941, to 204 and 74 in May<br>(643 sorties).

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Nevertheless, it was radar that proved to<br>be critical weapon in the night battles<br>over Britain from this point onward.

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>From November 1940 – February 1941, the<br>Luftwaffe shifted its strategy and attacked other<br>industrial cities. In particular, the West Midlands<br>were targeted.

Other sources say 449 bombers and<br>a total of 530 short tons (480<br>t) of bombs were dropped. The raid<br>against Coventry was particularly devastating, and led<br>to widespread use of the phrase \"to<br>conventrate\". Over 10,000 incendiaries were dropped. Around<br>21 factories were seriously damaged in Coventry,<br>and loss of public utilities stopped work<br>at nine others, disrupting industrial output for<br>several months.

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Five nights later, Birmingham was hit by<br>369 bombers from KG 54, KG 26,<br>and KG 55. By the end of<br>November, 1,100 bombers were available for night<br>raids.

          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Although official German air doctrine did target<br>civilian morale, it did not espouse the<br>attacking of civilians directly. It hoped to<br>destroy morale by destroying the enemy's factories<br>and public utilities as well as its<br>food stocks (by attacking shipping). Nevertheless, its<br>official opposition to attacks on civilians became<br>an increasingly moot point when large-scale raids<br>were conducted in November and December 1940.<br>Although not encouraged by official policy, the<br>use of mines and incendiaries, for tactical<br>expediency, came close to indiscriminate bombing. Locating<br>targets in skies obscured by industrial haze<br>meant they needed to be illuminated \"without<br>regard for the civilian population\".",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Special units, such as KGr 100, became<br>the Beleuchtergruppe (Firelighter Group), which used incendiaries<br>and high explosive to mark the target<br>area. The tactic was expanded into Feuerleitung<br>(Blaze Control) with the creation of Brandbombenfelder<br>(Incendiary Fields) to mark targets. These were<br>marked out by parachute flares. Then bombers<br>carrying SC 1000 (1,000 kg (2,205 lb)),<br>SC 1400 (1,400 kg (3,086 lb)), and<br>SC 1800 (1,800 kg (3,968 lb)) \"Satan\"<br>bombs were used to level streets and<br>residential areas. By December, the SC 2500<br>(2,500 kg (5,512 lb)) \"Max\" bomb was<br>used.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>These decisions, apparently taken at the Luftflotte<br>or Fliegerkorps level (see Organisation of the<br>Luftwaffe (1933–1945)), meant attacks on individual targets<br>were gradually replaced by what was, for<br>all intents and purposes, an unrestricted area<br>attack or Terrorangriff (Terror Attack). Part of<br>the reason for this was inaccuracy of<br>navigation. The effectiveness of British countermeasures against<br>Knickebein, which was designed to avoid area<br>attacks, forced the Luftwaffe to resort to<br>these methods. The shift from precision bombing<br>to area attack is indicated in the<br>tactical methods and weapons dropped. KGr 100<br>increased its use of incendiaries from 13–28<br>percent. By December, this had increased to<br>92 percent. Use of incendiaries, which were<br>inherently inaccurate, indicated much less care was<br>taken to avoid civilian property close to<br>industrial sites. Other units ceased using parachute<br>flares and opted for explosive target markers.<br>Captured German air crews also indicated the<br>homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>In 1941, the Luftwaffe shifted strategy again.<br>Erich Raeder—commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine—had long argued<br>the Luftwaffe should support the German submarine<br>force (U-Bootwaffe) in the Battle of the<br>Atlantic by attacking shipping in the Atlantic<br>Ocean and attacking British ports. Eventually, he<br>convinced Hitler of the need to attack<br>British port facilities. Hitler had been convinced<br>by Raeder that this was the right<br>course of action due to the high<br>success rates of the U-Boat force during<br>this period of the war. Hitler correctly<br>noted that the greatest damage to the<br>British war economy had been done through<br>submarines and air attacks by small numbers<br>of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 naval aircraft. He<br>ordered attacks to be carried out on<br>those targets which were also the target<br>of the Kriegsmarine. This meant that British<br>coastal centres and shipping at sea west<br>of Ireland were the prime targets.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Hitler's interest in this strategy forced Göring<br>and Jeschonnek to review the air war<br>against Britain in January 1941. This led<br>to Göring and Jeschonnek agreeing to Hitler's<br>Directive 23, Directions for operations against the<br>British War Economy, which was published on<br>6 February 1941 and gave aerial interdiction<br>of British imports by sea top priority.<br>This strategy had been recognised before the<br>war, but Operation Eagle Attack and the<br>following Battle of Britain had got in<br>the way of striking at Britain's sea<br>communications and diverted German air strength to<br>the campaign against the RAF and its<br>supporting structures. The OKL had always regarded<br>the interdiction of sea communications of less<br>importance than bombing land-based aircraft industries.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Directive 23 was the only concession made<br>by Göring to the Kriegsmarine over the<br>strategic bombing strategy of the Luftwaffe against<br>Britain. Thereafter, he would refuse to make<br>available any air units to destroy British<br>dockyards, ports, port facilities, or shipping in<br>dock or at sea, lest Kriegsmarine gain<br>control of more Luftwaffe units. Raeder's successor—Karl<br>Dönitz—would—on the intervention of Hitler—gain control of<br>one unit (KG 40), but Göring would<br>soon regain it. Göring's lack of cooperation<br>was detrimental to the one air strategy<br>with potentially decisive strategic effect on Britain.<br>Instead, he wasted aircraft of Fliegerführer Atlantik<br>(Flying Command Atlantic) on bombing mainland Britain<br>instead of attacks against convoys. For Göring,<br>his prestige had been damaged by the<br>defeat in the Battle of Britain, and<br>he wanted to regain it by subduing<br>Britain by air power alone. He was<br>always reluctant to cooperate with Raeder.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>Even so, the decision by OKL to<br>support the strategy in Directive 23 was<br>instigated by two considerations, both of which<br>had little to do with wanting to<br>destroy Britain's sea communications in conjunction with<br>the Kriegsmarine. First, the difficulty in estimating<br>the impact of bombing upon war production<br>was becoming apparent, and second, the conclusion<br>British morale was unlikely to break led<br>OKL to adopt the naval option. The<br>indifference displayed by OKL to Directive 23<br>was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives<br>which diluted its effect. They emphasised the<br>core strategic interest was attacking ports but<br>they insisted in maintaining pressure, or diverting<br>strength, onto industries building aircraft, anti-aircraft guns,<br>and explosives. Other targets would be considered<br>if the primary ones could not be<br>attacked because of weather conditions.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>A further line in the directive stressed<br>the need to inflict the heaviest losses<br>possible, but also to intensify the air<br>war in order to create the impression<br>an amphibious assault on Britain was planned<br>for 1941. However, meteorological conditions over Britain<br>were not favourable for flying and prevented<br>an escalation in air operations. Airfields became<br>water-logged and the 18 Kampfgruppen (bomber groups)<br>of the Luftwaffe's Kampfgeschwadern (bomber wings) were<br>relocated to Germany for rest and re-equipment.",
          "<b>The_Blitz</b><br>From the German point of view, March<br>1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew<br>4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major<br>and three heavy attacks.

Each series is commonly based<br>on the original storyline but things are<br>added to make them unique.

Each Kid was given a Digivice<br>which selected them to be transported to<br>the DigiWorld and was destined to be<br>paired up with a Digimon Partner, such<br>as Tai being paired up with Agumon<br>and Matt with Gabumon. The children are<br>helped by a mysterious man/digimon named Gennai,<br>who helps them via hologram. The Digivices<br>help their Digimon allies to Digivolve into<br>stronger creatures in times of peril. The<br>Digimon usually reached higher forms when their<br>human partners are placed in dangerous situations,<br>such as fighting the evil forces of<br>Devimon, Etemon and Myotismon in their Champion<br>forms.

          "<b>Digimon</b><br>The third Digimon series, which began airing<br>on April 1, 2001, is set largely<br>in a \"real world\" where the Adventure<br>and Adventure 02 series are television shows,<br>and where Digimon game merchandise (based on<br>actual items) become key to providing power<br>boosts to real Digimon which appear in<br>that world. The plot revolves around three<br>Tamers, Takato Matsuki, Rika Nonaka, and Henry<br>Wong. It began with Takato creating his<br>own Digimon partner by sliding a mysterious<br>blue card through his card reader, which<br>then became a D-Power. Guilmon takes form<br>from Takato's sketchings of a new Digimon.<br>(Tamers’ only human connection to the Adventure<br>series is Ryo Akiyama, a character featured<br>in some of the Digimon video games<br>and who made an appearance in some<br>occasions of the Adventure story-line.) Some of<br>the changes in this series include the<br>way the Digimon digivolve with the introduction<br>of Biomerge-Digivolution and the way their \"Digivices\"<br>work. In this series, the Tamers can<br>slide game cards through their \"Digivices\" and<br>give their Digimon partners certain advantages, as<br>in the card game. This act is<br>called \"Digi-Modify\" (Card Slash in the Japanese<br>version). The same process was often used<br>to Digivolve the Digimon, but as usual,<br>emotions play a big part in the<br>digivolving process. Unlike the two seasons before<br>it and most of the seasons that<br>followed, Digimon Tamers takes a darker and<br>more realistic approach to its story featuring<br>Digimon who do not reincarnate after their<br>deaths and more complex character development in<br>the original Japanese. The anime has become<br>controversial over the decade, with debates about<br>how appropriate this show actually is for<br>its \"target\" audience, especially due to the<br>Lovecraftian nature of the last arc. The<br>English dub is more lighthearted dialogue-wise, though<br>still not as much as previous series.",
          "<b>Digimon</b><br>The fourth Digimon series, which began airing<br>on April 7, 2002, radically departs from<br>the previous three by focusing on a<br>new and very different kind of evolution,<br>Spirit Evolution, in which the human characters<br>use their D-Tectors (this series' Digivice) to<br>transform themselves into special Digimon called Legendary<br>Warriors, detracting from the customary formula of<br>having digital partners. After receiving unusual phone<br>messages from Ophanimon (one of the three<br>ruling Digimon alongside Seraphimon and Cherubimon) Takuya<br>Kanbara, Koji Minamoto, Junpei Shibayama, Zoe Orimoto,<br>Tommy Himi, and Koichi Kimura go to<br>a subway station and take a train<br>to the Digital World. Summoned by Ophanimon,<br>the Digidestined realize that they must find<br>the ten legendary spirits and stop the<br>forces of Cherubimon from physically destroying the<br>Digital World. After finding the ten spirits<br>of the Legendary Warriors and defeating Mercurymon,<br>Grumblemon, Ranamon, and Arbormon, they finally end<br>up fighting Cherubimon hoping to foil his<br>effort to dominate the Digital World. After<br>the defeat of Cherubimon, the Digidestined find<br>they must face an even greater challenge<br>as they try to stop the Royal<br>Knights—Dynasmon and Crusadermon—from destroying the Digital World<br>and using the collected data to revive<br>the original ruler of the Digital World:<br>the tyrannical Lucemon. Ultimately the Digidestined fail<br>in preventing Lucemon from reawakening but they<br>do manage to prevent him from escaping<br>into the Real World. In the final<br>battle, all of the legendary spirits the<br>digidestined have collected thus far merge and<br>create Susanoomon. With this new form, the<br>digidestined are able to effectively defeat Lucemon<br>and save the Digital World. In general,<br>Frontier has a much lighter tone than<br>that of Tamers, yet remains darker than<br>Adventure and Adventure 02.",
          "<b>Digimon</b><br>After a three-year hiatus, a fifth Digimon<br>series began airing on April 2, 2006.<br>Like Frontier, Savers has no connection with<br>the previous installments, and also marks a<br>new start for the Digimon franchise, with<br>a drastic change in character designs and<br>story-line, in order to reach a broader<br>audience. The story focuses on the challenges<br>faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (\"Digital<br>Accident Tactics Squad\"), an organization created to<br>conceal the existence of the Digital World<br>and Digimon from the rest of mankind,<br>and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring<br>on Earth. Later the D.A.T.S. is dragged<br>into a massive conflict between Earth and<br>the Digital World, triggered by an ambitious<br>human scientist named Akihiro Kurata, determined to<br>make use of the Digimon for his<br>own personal gains. The English version was<br>dubbed by Studiopolis and it premiered on<br>the Jetix block on Toon Disney on<br>October 1, 2007. Digivolution in Data Squad<br>requires the human partner's DNA (\"Digital Natural<br>Ability\" in the English version and \"Digisoul\"<br>in the Japanese version) to activate, a<br>strong empathy with their Digimon and a<br>will to succeed. 'Digimon Savers' also introduces<br>a new form of digivolving called Burst<br>Mode which is essentially the level above<br>Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon<br>could take). Like previously in Tamers, this<br>plot takes on a dark tone throughout<br>the story and the anime was aimed,<br>originally in Japan, at an older audience<br>consisting of late teens and people in<br>their early twenties from ages 16 to<br>21. Because of that, along with the<br>designs, the anime being heavily edited and<br>localized for western US audiences like past<br>series, and the English dub being aimed<br>mostly toward younger audiences of children aged<br>6 to 10 and having a lower<br>TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis<br>dubbed the anime on Jetix with far<br>more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage.<br>This included giving the Japanese characters full<br>Americanized names and American surnames as well<br>as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon<br>as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru),<br>cultural streamlining and more edits to their<br>version similar to the changes 4Kids often<br>made (such as removal of Japanese text<br>for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite<br>all that, the setting of the country<br>was still in Japan and the characters<br>were Japanese in the dub. This series<br>was the first to show any Japanese<br>cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American<br>audiences (such as the manju), which were<br>left unedited and used in the English<br>dub. Also despite the heavy censorship and<br>the English dub aimed at young children,<br>some of the Digimon's attacks named after<br>real weapons such as RizeGreymon's Trident Revolver<br>are not edited and used in the<br>English dub.

According to the botanical criteria of<br>Frank White and geographer Robert Capot-Rey, the<br>northern limit of the Sahara corresponds to<br>the northern limit of date palm cultivation<br>and the southern limit of the range<br>of esparto, a grass typical of the<br>Mediterranean climate portion of the Maghreb and<br>Iberia.

This steady descending airflow<br>causes a warming and a drying effect<br>in the upper troposphere. The sinking air<br>prevents evaporating water from rising and, therefore,<br>prevents the adiabatic cooling, which makes cloud<br>formation extremely difficult to nearly impossible.",

A value<br>of 4,300 h or 98% of the<br>time would be recorded in Upper Egypt<br>(Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert<br>(Wadi Halfa). The annual average direct solar<br>irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year) in<br>the Great Desert. The Sahara has a<br>huge potential for solar energy production. The<br>constantly high position of the sun, the<br>extremely low relative humidity, the lack of<br>vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert<br>the hottest continuously large area worldwide and<br>certainly the hottest place on Earth during<br>summertime in some spots. The average high<br>temperature exceeds 38 °C (100.4 °F) -<br>40 °C (104 °F) during the hottest<br>month nearly everywhere in the desert except<br>at very high mountainous areas. The highest<br>officially recorded average high temperature was 47<br>°C (116.6 °F) in a remote desert<br>town in the Algerian Desert called Bou<br>Bernous with an elevation of 378 meters<br>above sea level.

He gained and has maintained<br>renown worldwide as one of the leading<br>musicians of his era, whose \"poetic genius<br>was based on a professional technique that<br>was without equal in his generation.\" Chopin<br>was born in what was then the<br>Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in<br>Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of<br>Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed<br>his musical education and composed his earlier<br>works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at<br>the age of 20, less than a<br>month before the outbreak of the November<br>1830 Uprising.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>At the age of 21 he settled<br>in Paris. Thereafter, during the last 18<br>years of his life, he gave only<br>some 30 public performances, preferring the more<br>intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported<br>himself by selling his compositions and teaching<br>piano, for which he was in high<br>demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz<br>Liszt and was admired by many of<br>his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In<br>1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a<br>failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska, from 1837<br>to 1847 he maintained an often troubled<br>relationship with the French writer George Sand.<br>A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca<br>with Sand in 1838–39 was one of<br>his most productive periods of composition. In<br>his last years, he was financially supported<br>by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also<br>arranged for him to visit Scotland in<br>1848. Through most of his life, Chopin<br>suffered from poor health. He died in<br>Paris in 1849, probably of tuberculosis.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>All of Chopin's compositions include the piano.<br>Most are for solo piano, though he<br>also wrote two piano concertos, a few<br>chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish<br>lyrics.

Influences on his compositional style include<br>Polish folk music, the classical tradition of<br>J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, the<br>music of all of whom he admired,<br>as well as the Paris salons where<br>he was a frequent guest.

Fryderyk lived with his<br>family in the Palace grounds. The father<br>played the flute and violin; the mother<br>played the piano and gave lessons to<br>boys in the boarding house that the<br>Chopins kept.

By the age of<br>seven Fryderyk had begun giving public concerts,<br>and in 1817 he composed two polonaises,<br>in G minor and B-flat major.

          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>From September 1823 to 1826 Chopin attended<br>the Warsaw Lyceum, where he received organ<br>lessons from the Czech musician Wilhelm Würfel<br>during his first year. In the autumn<br>of 1826 he began a three-year course<br>under the Silesian composer Józef Elsner at<br>the Warsaw Conservatory, studying music theory, figured<br>bass and composition.[n 3] Throughout this period<br>he continued to compose and to give<br>recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw.<br>He was engaged by the inventors of<br>a mechanical organ, the \"eolomelodicon\", and on<br>this instrument in May 1825 he performed<br>his own improvisation and part of a<br>concerto by Moscheles. The success of this<br>concert led to an invitation to give<br>a similar recital on the instrument before<br>Tsar Alexander I, who was visiting Warsaw;<br>the Tsar presented him with a diamond<br>ring. At a subsequent eolomelodicon concert on<br>10 June 1825, Chopin performed his Rondo<br>Op. 1.

Here for<br>the first time he encountered Polish rural<br>folk music. His letters home from Szafarnia<br>(to which he gave the title \"The<br>Szafarnia Courier\"), written in a very modern<br>and lively Polish, amused his family with<br>their spoofing of the Warsaw newspapers and<br>demonstrated the youngster's literary gift.",

          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Four boarders at his parents' apartments became<br>Chopin's intimates: Tytus Woyciechowski, Jan Nepomucen Białobłocki,<br>Jan Matuszyński and Julian Fontana; the latter<br>two would become part of his Paris<br>milieu. He was friendly with members of<br>Warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including<br>Fontana, Józef Bohdan Zaleski and Stefan Witwicki.<br>He was also attracted to the singing<br>student Konstancja Gładkowska. In letters to Woyciechowski,<br>he indicated which of his works, and<br>even which of their passages, were influenced<br>by his fascination with her; his letter<br>of 15 May 1830 revealed that the<br>slow movement (Larghetto) of his Piano Concerto<br>No. 1 (in E minor) was secretly<br>dedicated to her – \"It should be<br>like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by<br>moonlight.\" His final Conservatory report (July 1829)<br>read: \"Chopin F., third-year student, exceptional talent,<br>musical genius.\"",

          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Back in Warsaw that year, Chopin heard<br>Niccolò Paganini play the violin, and composed<br>a set of variations, Souvenir de Paganini.<br>It may have been this experience which<br>encouraged him to commence writing his first<br>Études, (1829–32), exploring the capacities of his<br>own instrument. On 11 August, three weeks<br>after completing his studies at the Warsaw<br>Conservatory, he made his debut in Vienna.<br>He gave two piano concerts and received<br>many favourable reviews—in addition to some commenting<br>(in Chopin's own words) that he was<br>\"too delicate for those accustomed to the<br>piano-bashing of local artists\". In one of<br>these concerts, he premiered his Variations on<br>Là ci darem la mano, Op. 2<br>(variations on an aria from Mozart's opera<br>Don Giovanni) for piano and orchestra. He<br>returned to Warsaw in September 1829, where<br>he premiered his Piano Concerto No. 2<br>in F minor, Op. 21 on 17<br>March 1830.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Chopin's successes as a composer and performer<br>opened the door to western Europe for<br>him, and on 2 November 1830, he<br>set out, in the words of Zdzisław<br>Jachimecki, \"into the wide world, with no<br>very clearly defined aim, forever.\" With Woyciechowski,<br>he headed for Austria, intending to go<br>on to Italy.

          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Chopin arrived in Paris in late September<br>1831; he would never return to Poland,<br>thus becoming one of many expatriates of<br>the Polish Great Emigration.

Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that<br>he never considered himself to be French,<br>despite his father's French origins, and always<br>saw himself as a Pole.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>In Paris, Chopin encountered artists and other<br>distinguished figures, and found many opportunities to<br>exercise his talents and achieve celebrity. During<br>his years in Paris he was to<br>become acquainted with, among many others, Hector<br>Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Ferdinand Hiller, Heinrich Heine,<br>Eugène Delacroix, and Alfred de Vigny. Chopin<br>was also acquainted with the poet Adam<br>Mickiewicz, principal of the Polish Literary Society,<br>some of whose verses he set as<br>songs.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Two Polish friends in Paris were also<br>to play important roles in Chopin's life<br>there. His fellow student at the Warsaw<br>Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had originally tried unsuccessfully<br>to establish himself in England; Albert Grzymała,<br>who in Paris became a wealthy financier<br>and society figure, often acted as Chopin's<br>adviser and \"gradually began to fill the<br>role of elder brother in [his] life.\"<br>Fontana was to become, in the words<br>of Michałowski and Samson, Chopin's \"general factotum<br>and copyist\".",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>At the end of 1831, Chopin received<br>the first major endorsement from an outstanding<br>contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing the Op.<br>2 Variations in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung<br>(his first published article on music), declared:<br>\"Hats off, gentlemen! A genius.\" On 26<br>February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris<br>concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew<br>universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote<br>in the Revue et gazette musicale: \"Here<br>is a young man who ... taking<br>no model, has found, if not a<br>complete renewal of piano music, ... an<br>abundance of original ideas of a kind<br>to be found nowhere else ...\" After<br>this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially<br>intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for<br>large concert spaces. Later that year he<br>was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking<br>family, whose patronage also opened doors for<br>him to other private salons (social gatherings<br>of the aristocracy and artistic and literary<br>elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin<br>had established himself among the Parisian musical<br>elite, and had earned the respect of<br>his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and<br>Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon<br>his father, and in the winter of<br>1832 he began earning a handsome income<br>from publishing his works and teaching piano<br>to affluent students from all over Europe.<br>This freed him from the strains of<br>public concert-giving, which he disliked.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In<br>later years he generally gave a single<br>annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a<br>venue that seated three hundred. He played<br>more frequently at salons, but preferred playing<br>at his own Paris apartment for small<br>groups of friends. The musicologist Arthur Hedley<br>has observed that \"As a pianist Chopin<br>was unique in acquiring a reputation of<br>the highest order on the basis of<br>a minimum of public appearances—few more than<br>thirty in the course of his lifetime.\"<br>The list of musicians who took part<br>in some of his concerts provides an<br>indication of the richness of Parisian artistic<br>life during this period. Examples include a<br>concert on 23 March 1833, in which<br>Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos)<br>a concerto by J.S. Bach for three<br>keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a<br>concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe<br>Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph<br>Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands,<br>of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony.<br>Chopin was also involved in the composition<br>of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth<br>(and final) variation on Bellini's theme. Chopin's<br>music soon found success with publishers, and<br>in 1833 he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger,<br>who arranged for it to be published<br>not only in France but, through his<br>family connections, also in Germany and England.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended<br>the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle<br>with Hiller, and it was there that<br>Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival,<br>the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had<br>been appointed musical director. They spent what<br>Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\",<br>playing and discussing music at his piano,<br>and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of<br>the Academy of Art, and some of<br>his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann,<br>Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went<br>to Carlsbad, where he spent time with<br>his parents; it was the last time<br>he would see them. On his way<br>back to Paris, he met old friends<br>from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made<br>the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in<br>Poland five years earlier, when she was<br>eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay<br>for two weeks in Dresden, when he<br>had previously intended to return to Paris<br>via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of<br>the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's,<br>as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October<br>he finally reached Leipzig, where he met<br>Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who<br>organised for him a performance of his<br>own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered<br>him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836<br>Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to<br>be with the Wodziński family, and in<br>September he proposed to Maria, whose mother<br>Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went<br>on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann<br>with his G minor Ballade. At the<br>end of 1836 he sent Maria an<br>album in which his sister Ludwika had<br>inscribed seven of his songs, and his<br>1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27,<br>No. 1.

          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Although it is not known exactly when<br>Chopin first met Liszt after arriving in<br>Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned<br>in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski<br>that \"I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot,<br>etc.—also Kalkbrenner. You would not believe how<br>curious I was about Herz, Liszt, Hiller,<br>etc.\" Liszt was in attendance at Chopin's<br>Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at<br>the Salle Pleyel, which led him to<br>remark: \"The most vigorous applause seemed not<br>to suffice to our enthusiasm in the<br>presence of this talented musician, who revealed<br>a new phase of poetic sentiment combined<br>with such happy innovation in the form<br>of his art.\"",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>The two became friends, and for many<br>years lived in close proximity in Paris,<br>Chopin at 38 Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin,<br>and Liszt at the Hôtel de France<br>on the Rue Lafitte, a few blocks<br>away. They performed together on seven occasions<br>between 1833 and 1841. The first, on<br>2 April 1833, was at a benefit<br>concert organized by Hector Berlioz for his<br>bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife Harriet Smithson, during<br>which they played George Onslow's Sonata in<br>F minor for piano duet.

          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Although the two displayed great respect and<br>admiration for each other, their friendship was<br>uneasy and had some qualities of a<br>love-hate relationship.

Liszt was the dedicatee of<br>Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance<br>of them prompted the composer to write<br>to Hiller, \"I should like to rob<br>him of the way he plays my<br>studies.\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843<br>when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes<br>with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments,<br>at which Chopin remarked that he should<br>play the music as written or not<br>play it at all, forcing an apology.<br>Most biographers of Chopin state that after<br>this the two had little to do<br>with each other, although in his letters<br>dated as late as 1848 he still<br>referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\".<br>Some commentators point to events in the<br>two men's romantic lives which led to<br>a rift between them; there are claims<br>that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his<br>mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while<br>others believe that Chopin had become concerned<br>about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>In 1836, at a party hosted by<br>Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author<br>George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).<br>Short (under five feet, or 152 cm),<br>dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she<br>initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, \"What an<br>unattractive person la Sand is. Is she<br>really a woman?\" However, by early 1837<br>Maria Wodzińska's mother had made it clear<br>to Chopin in correspondence that a marriage<br>with her daughter was unlikely to proceed.<br>It is thought that she was influenced<br>by his poor health and possibly also<br>by rumours about his associations with women<br>such as d'Agoult and Sand. Chopin finally<br>placed the letters from Maria and her<br>mother in a package on which he<br>wrote, in Polish, \"My tragedy\". Sand, in<br>a letter to Grzymała of June 1838,<br>admitted strong feelings for the composer and<br>debated whether to abandon a current affair<br>in order to begin a relationship with<br>Chopin; she asked Grzymała to assess Chopin's<br>relationship with Maria Wodzińska, without realising that<br>the affair, at least from Maria's side,<br>was over.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito<br>in the company of the piano manufacturer<br>Camille Pleyel where he played at a<br>musical soirée at the house of English<br>piano maker James Broadwood. On his return<br>to Paris, his association with Sand began<br>in earnest, and by the end of<br>June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand,<br>who was six years older than the<br>composer, and who had had a series<br>of lovers, wrote at this time: \"I<br>must say I was confused and amazed<br>at the effect this little creature had<br>on me ... I have still not<br>recovered from my astonishment, and if I<br>were a proud person I should be<br>feeling humiliated at having been carried away<br>...\" The two spent a miserable winter<br>on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13<br>February 1839), where, together with Sand's two<br>children, they had journeyed in the hope<br>of improving the health of Chopin and<br>that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and<br>also to escape the threats of Sand's<br>former lover Félicien Mallefille. After discovering that<br>the couple were not married, the deeply<br>traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable,<br>making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled<br>the group to take lodgings in a<br>former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave<br>little shelter from the cold winter weather.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>On 3 December, Chopin complained about his<br>bad health and the incompetence of the<br>doctors in Majorca: \"Three doctors have visited<br>me ...

His style<br>was based extensively on his use of<br>very independent finger technique. In his Projet<br>de méthode he wrote: \"Everything is a<br>matter of knowing good fingering ... we<br>need no less to use the rest<br>of the hand, the wrist, the forearm<br>and the upper arm.\" He further stated:<br>\"One needs only to study a certain<br>position of the hand in relation to<br>the keys to obtain with ease the<br>most beautiful quality of sound, to know<br>how to play short notes and long<br>notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\" The<br>consequences of this approach to technique in<br>Chopin's music include the frequent use of<br>the entire range of the keyboard, passages<br>in double octaves and other chord groupings,<br>swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace<br>notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms<br>(four against three, for example) between the<br>hands.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Polish composers of the following generation included<br>virtuosi such as Moritz Moszkowski, but, in<br>the opinion of J. Barrie Jones, his<br>\"one worthy successor\" among his compatriots was<br>Karol Szymanowski (1882–1937). Edvard Grieg, Antonín Dvořák,<br>Isaac Albéniz, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Sergei<br>Rachmaninoff, among others, are regarded by critics<br>as having been influenced by Chopin's use<br>of national modes and idioms. Alexander Scriabin<br>was devoted to the music of Chopin,<br>and his early published works include nineteen<br>mazurkas, as well as numerous études and<br>preludes; his teacher Nikolai Zverev drilled him<br>in Chopin's works to improve his virtuosity<br>as a performer. In the 20th century,<br>composers who paid homage to (or in<br>some cases parodied) the music of Chopin<br>included George Crumb, Bohuslav Martinů, Darius Milhaud,<br>Igor Stravinsky and Heitor Villa-Lobos.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Jonathan Bellman writes that modern concert performance<br>style—set in the \"conservatory\" tradition of late<br>19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable<br>for large auditoria or recordings—militates against what<br>is known of Chopin's more intimate performance<br>technique. The composer himself said to a<br>pupil that \"concerts are never real music,<br>you have to give up the idea<br>of hearing in them all the most<br>beautiful things of art.\" Contemporary accounts indicate<br>that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures<br>sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as<br>\"always crescendo to a high note\", but<br>that he was concerned with expressive phrasing,<br>rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. Berlioz wrote<br>in 1853 that Chopin \"has created a<br>kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect<br>is so strange and piquant as to<br>be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody<br>but Chopin himself can play this music<br>and give it this unusual turn\". Hiller<br>wrote that \"What in the hands of<br>others was elegant embellishment, in his hands<br>became a colourful wreath of flowers.\"",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Chopin's music is frequently played with rubato,<br>\"the practice in performance of disregarding strict<br>time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect\".<br>There are differing opinions as to how<br>much, and what type, of rubato is<br>appropriate for his works. Charles Rosen comments<br>that \"most of the written-out indications of<br>rubato in Chopin are to be found<br>in his mazurkas ... It is probable<br>that Chopin used the older form of<br>rubato so important to Mozart ... [where]<br>the melody note in the right hand<br>is delayed until after the note in<br>the bass ... An allied form of<br>this rubato is the arpeggiation of the<br>chords thereby delaying the melody note; according<br>to Chopin's pupil, Karol Mikuli, Chopin was<br>firmly opposed to this practice.\"",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Friederike Müller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote:<br>\"[His] playing was always noble and beautiful;<br>his tones sang, whether in full forte<br>or softest piano. He took infinite pains<br>to teach his pupils this legato, cantabile<br>style of playing. His most severe criticism<br>was 'He—or she—does not know how to<br>join two notes together.' He also demanded<br>the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated<br>all lingering and dragging, misplaced rubatos, as<br>well as exaggerated ritardandos ... and it<br>is precisely in this respect that people<br>make such terrible errors in playing his<br>works.\"",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has<br>been credited with introducing to music a<br>new sense of nationalism. Schumann, in his<br>1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted<br>the composer's strong feelings for his native<br>Poland, writing that \"Now that the Poles<br>are in deep mourning [after the failure<br>of the November 1830 rising], their appeal<br>to us artists is even stronger ...<br>If the mighty autocrat in the north<br>[i.e. Nicholas I of Russia] could know<br>that in Chopin's works, in the simple<br>strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a<br>dangerous enemy, he would place a ban<br>on his music. Chopin's works are cannon<br>buried in flowers!\" The biography of Chopin<br>published in 1863 under the name of<br>Franz Liszt (but probably written by Carolyne<br>zu Sayn-Wittgenstein) claims that Chopin \"must be<br>ranked first among the first musicians ...<br>individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of<br>an entire nation.\"",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating<br>Chopin's primacy as a \"nationalist\" or \"patriotic\"<br>composer. George Golos refers to earlier \"nationalist\"<br>composers in Central Europe, including Poland's Michał<br>Kleofas Ogiński and Franciszek Lessel, who utilised<br>polonaise and mazurka forms. Barbara Milewski suggests<br>that Chopin's experience of Polish music came<br>more from \"urbanised\" Warsaw versions than from<br>folk music, and that attempts (by Jachimecki<br>and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music<br>in his works are without basis. Richard<br>Taruskin impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works<br>as patronizing and comments that Chopin \"felt<br>his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely\" but<br>consciously modelled his works on the tradition<br>of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Field.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>A reconciliation of these views is suggested<br>by William Atwood: \"Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of<br>traditional musical forms like the polonaise and<br>mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense<br>of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across<br>Europe and the New World ... While<br>some sought solace in [them], others found<br>them a source of strength in their<br>continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music<br>undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than<br>through any conscious patriotic design, it served<br>all the same to symbolize the will<br>of the Polish people ...\"",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Jones comments that \"Chopin's unique position as<br>a composer, despite the fact that virtually<br>everything he wrote was for the piano,<br>has rarely been questioned.\" He also notes<br>that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in<br>Paris in 1831—\"the artistic environment, the publishers<br>who were willing to print his music,<br>the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what<br>Chopin asked for their lessons\"—and these factors,<br>as well as his musical genius, also<br>fuelled his contemporary and later reputation. While<br>his illness and his love-affairs conform to<br>some of the stereotypes of romanticism, the<br>rarity of his public recitals (as opposed<br>to performances at fashionable Paris soirées) led<br>Arthur Hutchings to suggest that \"his lack<br>of Byronic flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness<br>make him exceptional\" among his romantic contemporaries,<br>such as Liszt and Henri Herz.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Chopin's qualities as a pianist and composer<br>were recognized by many of his fellow<br>musicians. Schumann named a piece for him<br>in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later<br>dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F<br>major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music<br>can be traced in many of Liszt's<br>later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano<br>six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less<br>fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom<br>he discussed elements of folk music, and<br>who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.",
          "<b>Frédéric_Chopin</b><br>Two of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli<br>(1821–1897) and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano<br>teachers and passed on details of his<br>playing to their own students, some of<br>whom (such as Raoul Koczalski) were to<br>make recordings of his music. Other pianists<br>and composers influenced by Chopin's style include<br>Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Édouard Wolff (1816–1880) and<br>Pierre Zimmermann. Debussy dedicated his own 1915<br>piano Études to the memory of Chopin;<br>he frequently played Chopin's music during his<br>studies at the Paris Conservatoire, and undertook<br>the editing of Chopin's piano music for<br>the publisher Jacques Durand.",

The latter featured<br>\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one<br>in the UK for nine weeks and<br>popularised the music video.

They recorded four<br>of their own songs, \"Liar\", \"Keep Yourself<br>Alive\", \"The Night Comes Down\" and \"Jesus\",<br>for a demo tape; no record companies<br>were interested. It was also around this<br>time Freddie changed his surname to \"Mercury\",<br>inspired by the line \"Mother Mercury, look<br>what they've done to me\" in the<br>song \"My Fairy King\". On 2 July<br>1971, Queen played their first show in<br>the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor<br>and Deacon at a Surrey college outside<br>London.",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>Having attended art college, Mercury also designed<br>Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly<br>before the release of the band's first<br>album.

The note is<br>widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-\"hard\"-rock<br>stance by the band, but was later<br>revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to<br>be an attempt to clarify that those<br>albums' multi-layered solos were created with guitars,<br>not synths, as record company executives kept<br>assuming at the time. In September 1980,<br>Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison<br>Square Garden. In 1980, Queen also released<br>the soundtrack they had recorded for Flash<br>Gordon. At the 1981 American Music Awards<br>in January, \"Another One Bites the Dust\"<br>won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single,<br>and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock<br>Band, Duo, or Group.",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>In February 1981, Queen travelled to South<br>America as part of The Game Tour,<br>and became the first major rock band<br>to play in Latin American stadiums. The<br>tour included five shows in Argentina, one<br>of which drew the largest single concert<br>crowd in Argentine history with an audience<br>of 300,000 in Buenos Aires and two<br>concerts at the Morumbi Stadium in São<br>Paulo, Brazil, where they played to an<br>audience of more than 131,000 people in<br>the first night (then the largest paying<br>audience for a single band anywhere in<br>the world) and more than 120,000 people<br>the following night. In October of the<br>same year, Queen performed for more than<br>150,000 fans on 9 October at Monterrey<br>(Estadio Universitario) and 17 and 18 at<br>Puebla (Estadio Zaragoza), Mexico. On 24 and<br>25 November, Queen played two sell out<br>nights at the Montreal Forum, Quebec, Canada.<br>One of Mercury's most notable performances of<br>The Game's final track, \"Save Me\", took<br>place in Montreal, and the concert is<br>recorded in the live album, Queen Rock<br>Montreal.",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>In 1982, the band released the album<br>Hot Space, a departure from their trademark<br>seventies sound, this time being a mixture<br>of rock, pop rock, dance, funk, and<br>R&B. Most of the album was recorded<br>in Munich during the most turbulent period<br>in the band's history, and Taylor and<br>May lamented the new sound, with both<br>being very critical of the influence Mercury's<br>personal manager Paul Prenter had on the<br>singer. May was also scathing of Prenter,<br>who was Mercury's manager from the early<br>1980s to 1984, for being dismissive of<br>the importance of radio stations, such as<br>the US networks, and their vital connection<br>between the artist and the community, and<br>for denying them access to Mercury. The<br>band stopped touring North America after their<br>Hot Space Tour, as their success there<br>had waned, although they would perform on<br>American television for the only time during<br>the eighth season premiere of Saturday Night<br>Live. Queen left Elektra Records, their label<br>in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia,<br>and New Zealand, and signed onto EMI/Capitol<br>Records.",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>That year, Queen began The Works Tour,<br>the first tour to feature keyboardist Spike<br>Edney as an extra live musician. The<br>tour featured nine sold-out dates in October<br>in Bophuthatswana, South Africa, at the arena<br>in Sun City. Upon returning to England,<br>they were the subject of outrage, having<br>played in South Africa during the height<br>of apartheid and in violation of worldwide<br>divestment efforts and a United Nations cultural<br>boycott. The band responded to the critics<br>by stating that they were playing music<br>for fans in South Africa, and they<br>also stressed that the concerts were played<br>before integrated audiences. Queen donated to a<br>school for the deaf and blind as<br>a philanthropic gesture but were fined by<br>the British Musicians' Union and placed on<br>the United Nations' blacklisted artists.",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>At Live Aid, held at Wembley on<br>13 July 1985, in front of the<br>biggest-ever TV audience of 1.9 billion, Queen<br>performed some of their greatest hits, during<br>which the sold-out stadium audience of 72,000<br>people clapped, sang, and swayed in unison.<br>The show's organisers, Bob Geldof and Midge<br>Ure, other musicians such as Elton John,<br>Cliff Richard and Dave Grohl, and music<br>journalists writing for the BBC, CNN, Rolling<br>Stone, MTV, The Telegraph among others, stated<br>that Queen stole the show. An industry<br>poll in 2005 ranked it the greatest<br>rock performance of all time. Mercury's powerful,<br>sustained note during the a cappella section<br>came to be known as \"The Note<br>Heard Round the World\".",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>When interviewed for Mojo magazine the band<br>said the most amazing sight at Live<br>Aid was to see the audience clapping<br>to \"Radio Ga Ga\". Brian May stated:<br>\"I'd never seen anything like that in<br>my life and it wasn't calculated either.<br>We understood our audience and played to<br>them but that was one of those<br>weird accidents because of the (music) video.<br>I remember thinking 'oh great, they've picked<br>it up' and then I thought 'this<br>is not a Queen audience'. This is<br>a general audience who've bought tickets before<br>they even knew we were on the<br>bill. And they all did it. How<br>did they know? Nobody told them to<br>do it.\"",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>The band, now revitalised by the response<br>to Live Aid – a \"shot in<br>the arm\" Roger Taylor called it, —<br>and the ensuing increase in record sales,<br>ended 1985 by releasing the single \"One<br>Vision\", which was the third time after<br>\"Stone Cold Crazy\" and \"Under Pressure (with<br>David Bowie)\" that all four bandmembers received<br>a writing credit for the one song.<br>Also, a limited-edition boxed set containing all<br>Queen albums to date was released under<br>the title of The Complete Works.

          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>In summer of 1986, Queen went on<br>their final tour with Freddie Mercury. A<br>sold-out tour in support of A Kind<br>of Magic, once again they hired Spike<br>Edney, leading to him being dubbed the<br>unofficial fifth member. The Magic Tour's highlight<br>was at Wembley Stadium in London and<br>resulted in the live double album, Queen<br>at Wembley, released on CD and as<br>a live concert DVD, which has gone<br>five times platinum in the US and<br>four times platinum in the UK. Queen<br>could not book Wembley for a third<br>night, but they did play at Knebworth<br>Park. The show sold out within two<br>hours and over 120,000 fans packed the<br>park for what was Queen's final live<br>performance with Mercury. Queen began the tour<br>at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm, Sweden,<br>and during the tour the band performed<br>a concert at Slane Castle, Ireland, in<br>front of an audience of 95,000, which<br>broke the venue's attendance record. The band<br>also played behind the Iron Curtain when<br>they performed to a crowd of 80,000<br>at the Népstadion in Budapest, in what<br>was one of the biggest rock concerts<br>ever held in Eastern Europe. More than<br>one million people saw Queen on the<br>tour—400,000 in the United Kingdom alone, a<br>record at the time.",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>After working on various solo projects during<br>1988 (including Mercury's collaboration with Montserrat Caballé,<br>Barcelona), the band released The Miracle in<br>1989. The album continued the direction of<br>A Kind of Magic, using a pop-rock<br>sound mixed with a few heavy numbers.<br>It spawned the European hits \"I Want<br>It All\", \"Breakthru\", \"The Invisible Man\", \"Scandal\",<br>and \"The Miracle\". The Miracle also began<br>a change in direction of Queen's songwriting<br>philosophy. Since the band's beginning, nearly all<br>songs had been written by and credited<br>to a single member, with other members<br>adding minimally. With The Miracle, the band's<br>songwriting became more collaborative, and they vowed<br>to credit the final product only to<br>Queen as a group.",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>After fans noticed Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance<br>in 1988, rumours began to spread that<br>Mercury was suffering from AIDS. Mercury flatly<br>denied this, insisting he was merely \"exhausted\"<br>and too busy to provide interviews. The<br>band decided to continue making albums, starting<br>with The Miracle in 1989 and continuing<br>with Innuendo in 1991. Despite his deteriorating<br>health, the lead singer continued to contribute.<br>For the last two albums made while<br>Mercury was still alive, the band credited<br>all songs to Queen, rather than specific<br>members of the group, freeing them of<br>internal conflict and differences. In 1990, Queen<br>ended their contract with Capitol and signed<br>with Disney's Hollywood Records, which has since<br>remained the group's music catalogue owner in<br>the United States and Canada. That same<br>year, Mercury made his final public appearance<br>when he joined the rest of Queen<br>to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding<br>Contribution to British Music.",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>Innuendo was released in early 1991 with<br>an eponymous number 1 UK hit and<br>other charting singles including, \"The Show Must<br>Go On\". Mercury was increasingly ill and<br>could barely walk when the band recorded<br>\"The Show Must Go On\" in 1990.<br>Because of this, May had concerns about<br>whether he was physically capable of singing<br>it. Recalling Mercury's successful performance May states;<br>\"he went in and killed it, completely<br>lacerated that vocal\". The rest of the<br>band were ready to record when Mercury<br>felt able to come in to the<br>studio, for an hour or two at<br>a time. May says of Mercury: “He<br>just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write<br>me stuff. I want to just sing<br>this and do it and when I<br>am gone you can finish it off.’<br>He had no fear, really.” The band's<br>second greatest hits compilation, Greatest Hits II,<br>followed in October 1991, which is the<br>eighth best-selling album of all time in<br>the UK and has sold 16 million<br>copies worldwide.",
          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>On 23 November 1991, in a prepared<br>statement made on his deathbed, Mercury confirmed<br>that he had AIDS. Within 24 hours<br>of the statement, he died of bronchial<br>pneumonia, which was brought on as a<br>complication of AIDS. His funeral service on<br>27 November in Kensal Green, West London<br>was private, and held in accordance with<br>the Zoroastrian religious faith of his family.<br>\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a single<br>shortly after Mercury's death, with \"These Are<br>the Days of Our Lives\" as the<br>double A-side.

          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>Queen's popularity was stimulated in North America<br>when \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was featured in the<br>1992 comedy film Wayne's World.

The compilation<br>album Classic Queen also reached number four<br>on the Billboard 200, and is certified<br>three times platinum in the US.

          "<b>Queen_(band)</b><br>Queen's last album featuring Mercury, titled Made<br>in Heaven, was finally released in 1995,<br>four years after his death. Featuring tracks<br>such as \"Too Much Love Will Kill<br>You\" and \"Heaven for Everyone\", it was<br>constructed from Mercury's final recordings in 1991,<br>material left over from their previous studio<br>albums and re-worked material from May, Taylor,<br>and Mercury's solo albums. The album also<br>featured the song \"Mother Love\", the last<br>vocal recording Mercury made prior to his<br>death, which he completed using a drum<br>machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon<br>later added the instrumental track. After completing<br>the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the<br>band he \"wasn't feeling that great\" and<br>stated, \"I will finish it when I<br>come back, next time\"; however, he never<br>made it back into the studio, so<br>May later recorded the final verse of<br>the song. Both stages of recording, before<br>and after Mercury's death, were completed at<br>the band's studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The<br>album reached No. 1 on the UK<br>charts immediately following its release, and has<br>sold 20 million copies worldwide.

It was released as a bonus<br>track on the Queen Rocks compilation album<br>later that year. In January 1997, Queen<br>performed \"The Show Must Go On\" live<br>with Elton John and the Béjart Ballet<br>in Paris on a night Mercury was<br>remembered, and it marked the last performance<br>and public appearance of John Deacon, who<br>chose to retire.

Tungsten filaments radiate mostly<br>infrared radiation at temperatures where they remain<br>solid – below 3,695 K (3,422 °C;<br>6,191 °F). Donald L.

To see why exponential-time<br>algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider<br>a program that makes 2n operations before<br>halting. For small n, say 100, and<br>assuming for the sake of example that<br>the computer does 1012 operations each second,<br>the program would run for about 4<br>× 1010 years, which is the same<br>order of magnitude as the age of<br>the universe. Even with a much faster<br>computer, the program would only be useful<br>for very small instances and in that<br>sense the intractability of a problem is<br>somewhat independent of technological progress. Nevertheless, a<br>polynomial time algorithm is not always practical.<br>If its running time is, say, n15,<br>it is unreasonable to consider it efficient<br>and it is still useless except on<br>small instances.",
          "<b>Computational_complexity_theory</b><br>What intractability means in practice is open<br>to debate. Saying that a problem is<br>not in P does not imply that<br>all large cases of the problem are<br>hard or even that most of them<br>are. For example, the decision problem in<br>Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to<br>be in P, yet algorithms have been<br>written that solve the problem in reasonable<br>times in most cases.

          "<b>Hard_rock</b><br>In the late 1960s, the term heavy<br>metal was used interchangeably with hard rock,<br>but gradually began to be used to<br>describe music played with even more volume<br>and intensity. While hard rock maintained a<br>bluesy rock and roll identity, including some<br>swing in the back beat and riffs<br>that tended to outline chord progressions in<br>their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned<br>as stand-alone melodies and had no swing<br>in them. Heavy metal took on \"darker\"<br>characteristics after Black Sabbath's breakthrough at the<br>beginning of the 1970s. In the 1980s<br>it developed a number of subgenres, often<br>termed extreme metal, some of which were<br>influenced by hardcore punk, and which further<br>differentiated the two styles. Despite this differentiation,<br>hard rock and heavy metal have existed<br>side by side, with bands frequently standing<br>on the boundary of, or crossing between,<br>the genres.",
          "<b>Hard_rock</b><br>By the end of the decade a<br>distinct genre of hard rock was emerging<br>with bands like Led Zeppelin, who mixed<br>the music of early rock bands with<br>a more hard-edged form of blues rock<br>and acid rock on their first two<br>albums Led Zeppelin (1969) and Led Zeppelin<br>II (1969), and Deep Purple, who began<br>as a progressive rock group but achieved<br>their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and<br>distinctively heavier album, In Rock (1970). Also<br>significant was Black Sabbath's Paranoid (1970), which<br>combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more<br>explicit references to the occult and elements<br>of Gothic horror. All three of these<br>bands have been seen as pivotal in<br>the development of heavy metal, but where<br>metal further accentuated the intensity of the<br>music, with bands like Judas Priest following<br>Sabbath's lead into territory that was often<br>\"darker and more menacing\", hard rock tended<br>to continue to remain the more exuberant,<br>good-time music.",
          "<b>Hard_rock</b><br>With the rise of disco in the<br>US and punk rock in the UK,<br>hard rock's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward<br>the later part of the decade. Disco<br>appealed to a more diverse group of<br>people and punk seemed to take over<br>the rebellious role that hard rock once<br>held. Early punk bands like The Ramones<br>explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and<br>extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock,<br>with almost all of their songs clocking<br>in around two minutes with no guitar<br>solos. However, new rock acts continued to<br>emerge and record sales remained high into<br>the 1980s. 1977 saw the début and<br>rise to stardom of Foreigner, who went<br>on to release several platinum albums through<br>to the mid-1980s. Midwestern groups like Kansas,<br>REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement<br>heavy rock in the Midwest as a<br>form of stadium rock. In 1978, Van<br>Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music<br>scene with a sound based around the<br>skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen.<br>He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed<br>hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping, showcased on<br>the song \"Eruption\" from the album Van<br>Halen, which was highly influential in re-establishing<br>hard rock as a popular genre after<br>the punk and disco explosion, while also<br>redefining and elevating the role of electric<br>guitar.",
          "<b>Hard_rock</b><br>Established acts benefited from the new commercial<br>climate, with Whitesnake's self-titled album (1987) selling<br>over 17 million copies, outperforming anything in<br>Coverdale's or Deep Purple's catalogue before or<br>since. It featured the rock anthem \"Here<br>I Go Again '87\" as one of<br>4 UK top 20 singles. The follow-up<br>Slip of the Tongue (1989) went platinum,<br>but according to critics Steve Erlwine and<br>Greg Prato, \"it was a considerable disappointment<br>after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake\". Aerosmith's<br>comeback album Permanent Vacation (1987) would begin<br>a decade long revival of their popularity.<br>Crazy Nights (1987) by Kiss was the<br>band's highest charting release in the US<br>since 1979 and the highest of their<br>career in the UK. Mötley Crüe with<br>Girls, Girls, Girls (1987) continued their commercial<br>success and Def Leppard with Hysteria (1987)<br>hit their commercial peak, the latter producing<br>seven hit singles (a record for a<br>hard rock act). Guns N' Roses released<br>the best-selling début of all time, Appetite<br>for Destruction (1987). With a \"grittier\" and<br>\"rawer\" sound than most glam metal, it<br>produced three top 10 hits, including the<br>number one \"Sweet Child O' Mine\". Some<br>of the glam rock bands that formed<br>in the mid-1980s, such as White Lion<br>and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during<br>this period with their respective albums Pride<br>(1987) and Long Cold Winter (1988) both<br>going multi-platinum and launching a series of<br>hit singles. In the last years of<br>the decade, the most notable successes were<br>New Jersey (1988) by Bon Jovi, OU812<br>(1988) by Van Halen, Open Up and<br>Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, Pump (1989)<br>by Aerosmith, and Mötley Crüe's most commercially<br>successful album Dr. Feelgood (1989). New Jersey<br>spawned five Top 10 singles, a record<br>for a hard rock act. In 1988<br>from 25 June to 5 November, the<br>number one spot on the Billboard 200<br>album chart was held by a hard<br>rock album for 18 out of 20<br>consecutive weeks; the albums were OU812, Hysteria,<br>Appetite for Destruction, and New Jersey. A<br>final wave of glam rock bands arrived<br>in the late 1980s, and experienced success<br>with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from<br>1989 until the early 1990s, among them<br>Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse. Skid Row<br>also released their eponymous début (1989), reaching<br>number six on the Billboard 200, but<br>they were to be one of the<br>last major bands that emerged in the<br>glam rock era.",

Muslims regard the Quran as the<br>most important miracle of Muhammad, a proof<br>of his prophethood, and the culmination of<br>a series of divine messages that started<br>with the messages revealed to Adam and<br>ended with Muhammad. The word \"Quran\" occurs<br>some 70 times in the text of<br>the Quran, although different names and words<br>are also said to be references to<br>the Quran.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>According to the traditional narrative, several companions<br>of Muhammad served as scribes and were<br>responsible for writing down the revelations. Shortly<br>after Muhammad's death, the Quran was compiled<br>by his companions who wrote down and<br>memorized parts of it. These codices had<br>differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to<br>establish a standard version now known as<br>Uthman's codex, which is generally considered the<br>archetype of the Quran known today. There<br>are, however, variant readings, with mostly minor<br>differences in meaning.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives<br>recounted in the Biblical scriptures. It summarizes<br>some, dwells at length on others and,<br>in some cases, presents alternative accounts and<br>interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself<br>as a book of guidance. It sometimes<br>offers detailed accounts of specific historical events,<br>and it often emphasizes the moral significance<br>of an event over its narrative sequence.<br>The Quran is used along with the<br>hadith to interpret sharia law. During prayers,<br>the Quran is recited only in Arabic.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>The word qurʼān appears about 70 times<br>in the Quran itself, assuming various meanings.<br>It is a verbal noun (maṣdar) of<br>the Arabic verb qaraʼa (قرأ), meaning \"he<br>read\" or \"he recited\". The Syriac equivalent<br>is (ܩܪܝܢܐ) qeryānā, which refers to \"scripture<br>reading\" or \"lesson\". While some Western scholars<br>consider the word to be derived from<br>the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities<br>hold the origin of the word is<br>qaraʼa itself. Regardless, it had become an<br>Arabic term by Muhammad's lifetime. An important<br>meaning of the word is the \"act<br>of reciting\", as reflected in an early<br>Quranic passage: \"It is for Us to<br>collect it and to recite it (qurʼānahu).\"",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>The term also has closely related synonyms<br>that are employed throughout the Quran. Each<br>synonym possesses its own distinct meaning, but<br>its use may converge with that of<br>qurʼān in certain contexts. Such terms include<br>kitāb (book); āyah (sign); and sūrah (scripture).<br>The latter two terms also denote units<br>of revelation. In the large majority of<br>contexts, usually with a definite article (al-),<br>the word is referred to as the<br>\"revelation\" (waḥy), that which has been \"sent<br>down\" (tanzīl) at intervals. Other related words<br>are: dhikr (remembrance), used to refer to<br>the Quran in the sense of a<br>reminder and warning, and ḥikmah (wisdom), sometimes<br>referring to the revelation or part of<br>it.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>The Quran describes itself as \"the discernment\"<br>(al-furqān), \"the mother book\" (umm al-kitāb), \"the<br>guide\" (huda), \"the wisdom\" (hikmah), \"the remembrance\"<br>(dhikr) and \"the revelation\" (tanzīl; something sent<br>down, signifying the descent of an object<br>from a higher place to lower place).<br>Another term is al-kitāb (The Book), though<br>it is also used in the Arabic<br>language for other scriptures, such as the<br>Torah and the Gospels. The adjective of<br>\"Quran\" has multiple transliterations including \"quranic\", \"koranic\",<br>and \"qur'anic\", or capitalised as \"Qur'anic\", \"Koranic\",<br>and \"Quranic\". The term mus'haf ('written work')<br>is often used to refer to particular<br>Quranic manuscripts but is also used in<br>the Quran to identify earlier revealed books.<br>Other transliterations of \"Quran\" include \"al-Coran\", \"Coran\",<br>\"Kuran\", and \"al-Qurʼan\".",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his<br>first revelation in the Cave of Hira<br>during one of his isolated retreats to<br>the mountains. Thereafter, he received revelations over<br>a period of 23 years. According to<br>hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad immigrated<br>to Medina and formed an independent Muslim<br>community, he ordered many of his companions<br>to recite the Quran and to learn<br>and teach the laws, which were revealed<br>daily. It is related that some of<br>the Quraysh who were taken prisoners at<br>the battle of Badr regained their freedom<br>after they had taught some of the<br>Muslims the simple writing of the time.<br>Thus a group of Muslims gradually became<br>literate. As it was initially spoken, the<br>Quran was recorded on tablets, bones, and<br>the wide, flat ends of date palm<br>fronds. Most suras were in use amongst<br>early Muslims since they are mentioned in<br>numerous sayings by both Sunni and Shia<br>sources, relating Muhammad's use of the Quran<br>as a call to Islam, the making<br>of prayer and the manner of recitation.<br>However, the Quran did not exist in<br>book form at the time of Muhammad's<br>death in 632. There is agreement among<br>scholars that Muhammad himself did not write<br>down the revelation.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>The Quran describes Muhammad as \"ummi\", which<br>is traditionally interpreted as \"illiterate,\" but the<br>meaning is rather more complex. Medieval commentators<br>such as Al-Tabari maintained that the term<br>induced two meanings: first, the inability to<br>read or write in general; second, the<br>inexperience or ignorance of the previous books<br>or scriptures (but they gave priority to<br>the first meaning). Muhammad's illiteracy was taken<br>as a sign of the genuineness of<br>his prophethood. For example, according to Fakhr<br>al-Din al-Razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing<br>and reading he possibly would have been<br>suspected of having studied the books of<br>the ancestors. Some scholars such as Watt<br>prefer the second meaning of \"ummi\" -<br>they take it to indicate unfamiliarity with<br>earlier sacred texts.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>Based on earlier transmitted reports, in the<br>year 632, after the demise of Muhammad<br>a number of his companions who knew<br>the Quran by heart were killed in<br>a battle by Musaylimah, the first caliph<br>Abu Bakr (d. 634) decided to collect<br>the book in one volume so that<br>it could be preserved. Zayd ibn Thabit<br>(d. 655) was the person to collect<br>the Quran since \"he used to write<br>the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\". Thus,<br>a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd,<br>collected the verses and produced a hand-written<br>manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript<br>according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr<br>until he died. Zayd's reaction to the<br>task and the difficulties in collecting the<br>Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin<br>stones and from men who knew it<br>by heart is recorded in earlier narratives.<br>After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's<br>widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In<br>about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn<br>Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences<br>in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam<br>expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia,<br>the Levant, and North Africa. In order<br>to preserve the sanctity of the text,<br>he ordered a committee headed by Zayd<br>to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare<br>a standard copy of the Quran. Thus,<br>within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the<br>Quran was committed to written form. That<br>text became the model from which copies<br>were made and promulgated throughout the urban<br>centers of the Muslim world, and other<br>versions are believed to have been destroyed.<br>The present form of the Quran text<br>is accepted by Muslim scholars to be<br>the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.",

Worn-out copies<br>of the Quran are wrapped in a<br>cloth and stored indefinitely in a safe<br>place, buried in a mosque or a<br>Muslim cemetery, or burned and the ashes<br>buried or scattered over water.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>Inimitability of the Quran (or \"I'jaz\") is<br>the belief that no human speech can<br>match the Quran in its content and<br>form. The Quran is considered an inimitable<br>miracle by Muslims, effective until the Day<br>of Resurrection—and, thereby, the central proof granted<br>to Muhammad in authentication of his prophetic<br>status. The concept of inimitability originates in<br>the Quran where in five different verses<br>opponents are challenged to produce something like<br>the Quran: \"If men and sprites banded<br>together to produce the like of this<br>Quran they would never produce its like<br>not though they backed one another.\" So<br>the suggestion is that if there are<br>doubts concerning the divine authorship of the<br>Quran, come forward and create something like<br>it. From the ninth century, numerous works<br>appeared which studied the Quran and examined<br>its style and content. Medieval Muslim scholars<br>including al-Jurjani (d. 1078) and al-Baqillani (d.<br>1013) have written treatises on the subject,<br>discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic<br>approaches to study the Quran. Others argue<br>that the Quran contains noble ideas, has<br>inner meanings, maintained its freshness through the<br>ages and has caused great transformations in<br>individual level and in the history. Some<br>scholars state that the Quran contains scientific<br>information that agrees with modern science. The<br>doctrine of miraculousness of the Quran is<br>further emphasized by Muhammad's illiteracy since the<br>unlettered prophet could not have been suspected<br>of composing the Quran.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>The Quran consists of 114 chapters of<br>varying lengths, each known as a sura.<br>Suras are classified as Meccan or Medinan,<br>depending on whether the verses were revealed<br>before or after the migration of Muhammad<br>to the city of Medina. However, a<br>sura classified as Medinan may contain Meccan<br>verses in it and vice versa. Sura<br>titles are derived from a name or<br>quality discussed in the text, or from<br>the first letters or words of the<br>sura. Suras are arranged roughly in order<br>of decreasing size. The sura arrangement is<br>thus not connected to the sequence of<br>revelation. Each sura except the ninth starts<br>with the Bismillah (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم),<br>an Arabic phrase meaning \"In the name<br>of God\". There are, however, still 114<br>occurrences of the Bismillah in the Quran,<br>due to its presence in Quran 27:30<br>as the opening of Solomon's letter to<br>the Queen of Sheba.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>In addition to and independent of the<br>division into suras, there are various ways<br>of dividing the Quran into parts of<br>approximately equal length for convenience in reading.<br>The 30 juz' (plural ajzāʼ) can be<br>used to read through the entire Quran<br>in a month.

The Quranic verses<br>contain general exhortations regarding right and wrong<br>and historical events are related to outline<br>general moral lessons. Verses pertaining to natural<br>phenomena have been interpreted by Muslims as<br>an indication of the authenticity of the<br>Quranic message.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>The doctrine of the last day and<br>eschatology (the final fate of the universe)<br>may be reckoned as the second great<br>doctrine of the Quran. It is estimated<br>that approximately one-third of the Quran is<br>eschatological, dealing with the afterlife in the<br>next world and with the day of<br>judgment at the end of time. There<br>is a reference to the afterlife on<br>most pages of the Quran and belief<br>in the afterlife is often referred to<br>in conjunction with belief in God as<br>in the common expression: \"Believe in God<br>and the last day\". A number of<br>suras such as 44, 56, 75, 78,<br>81 and 101 are directly related to<br>the afterlife and its preparations. Some suras<br>indicate the closeness of the event and<br>warn people to be prepared for the<br>imminent day. For instance, the first verses<br>of Sura 22, which deal with the<br>mighty earthquake and the situations of people<br>on that day, represent this style of<br>divine address: \"O People! Be respectful to<br>your Lord. The earthquake of the Hour<br>is a mighty thing.\"",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>According to the Quran, God communicated with<br>man and made his will known through<br>signs and revelations. Prophets, or 'Messengers of<br>God', received revelations and delivered them to<br>humanity. The message has been identical and<br>for all humankind. \"Nothing is said to<br>you that was not said to the<br>messengers before you, that your lord has<br>at his Command forgiveness as well as<br>a most Grievous Penalty.\" The revelation does<br>not come directly from God to the<br>prophets. Angels acting as God's messengers deliver<br>the divine revelation to them. This comes<br>out in Quran 42:51, in which it<br>is stated: \"It is not for any<br>mortal that God should speak to them,<br>except by revelation, or from behind a<br>veil, or by sending a messenger to<br>reveal by his permission whatsoever He will.\"",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>Belief is a fundamental aspect of morality<br>in the Quran, and scholars have tried<br>to determine the semantic contents of \"belief\"<br>and \"believer\" in the Quran. The ethico-legal<br>concepts and exhortations dealing with righteous conduct<br>are linked to a profound awareness of<br>God, thereby emphasizing the importance of faith,<br>accountability, and the belief in each human's<br>ultimate encounter with God. People are invited<br>to perform acts of charity, especially for<br>the needy. Believers who \"spend of their<br>wealth by night and by day, in<br>secret and in public\" are promised that<br>they \"shall have their reward with their<br>Lord; on them shall be no fear,<br>nor shall they grieve\". It also affirms<br>family life by legislating on matters of<br>marriage, divorce, and inheritance. A number of<br>practices, such as usury and gambling, are<br>prohibited. The Quran is one of the<br>fundamental sources of Islamic law (sharia). Some<br>formal religious practices receive significant attention in<br>the Quran including the formal prayers (salat)<br>and fasting in the month of Ramadan.<br>As for the manner in which the<br>prayer is to be conducted, the Quran<br>refers to prostration. The term for charity,<br>zakat, literally means purification. Charity, according to<br>the Quran, is a means of self-purification.",
          "<b>Quran</b><br>The astrophysicist Nidhal Guessoum while being highly<br>critical of pseudo-scientific claims made about the<br>Quran, has highlighted the encouragement for sciences<br>that the Quran provides by developing \"the<br>concept of knowledge.\". He writes: \"The Qur'an<br>draws attention to the danger of conjecturing<br>without evidence (And follow not that of<br>which you have not the (certain) knowledge<br>of... 17:36) and in several different verses<br>asks Muslims to require proofs (Say: Bring<br>your proof if you are truthful 2:111),<br>both in matters of theological belief and<br>in natural science.\" Guessoum cites Ghaleb Hasan<br>on the definition of \"proof\" according the<br>Quran being \"clear and strong... convincing evidence<br>or argument.\" Also, such a proof cannot<br>rely on an argument from authority, citing<br>verse 5:104. Lastly, both assertions and rejections<br>require a proof, according to verse 4:174.<br>Ismail al-Faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are<br>of the view that any reawakening of<br>the Muslim civilization must start with the<br>Quran; however, the biggest obstacle on this<br>route is the \"centuries old heritage of<br>tafseer (exegesis) and other classical disciplines\" which<br>inhibit a \"universal, epidemiological and systematic conception\"<br>of the Quran's message.

In 1439, while<br>employed in Naples at the court of<br>Alfonso V of Aragon (at the time<br>engaged in a dispute with the Papal<br>States) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic<br>textual analysis, now called philology, to prove<br>that the Donation of Constantine, which purported<br>to confer temporal powers on the Pope<br>of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery.

Eliot considered humanism to<br>be sentimental \"slop\" (Hulme)[citation needed] or \"an<br>old bitch gone in the teeth\" (Pound)<br>and wanted to go back to a<br>more manly, authoritarian society such as (they<br>believed) existed in the Middle Ages. Postmodern<br>critics who are self-described anti-humanists, such as<br>Jean-François Lyotard and Michel Foucault, have asserted<br>that humanism posits an overarching and excessively<br>abstract notion of humanity or universal human<br>nature, which can then be used as<br>a pretext for imperialism and domination of<br>those deemed somehow less than human. \"Humanism<br>fabricates the human as much as it<br>fabricates the nonhuman animal\", suggests Timothy Laurie,<br>turning the human into what he calls<br>\"a placeholder for a range of attributes<br>that have been considered most virtuous among<br>humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most<br>commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)\". Nevertheless, philosopher Kate<br>Soper notes that by faulting humanism for<br>falling short of its own benevolent ideals,<br>anti-humanism thus frequently \"secretes a humanist rhetoric\".",
          "<b>Humanism</b><br>In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies<br>calls these critics \"humanist anti-humanists\". Critics of<br>antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that<br>while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to<br>fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not<br>offer an alternative emancipatory project of their<br>own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger<br>considered themselves humanists on the model of<br>the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied<br>only to the German \"race\" and specifically<br>to the Nazis and thus, in Davies'<br>words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading<br>of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial;<br>Heidegger includes his own views and critique<br>of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies<br>acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of<br>the wars of the 20th century \"it<br>should no longer be possible to formulate<br>phrases like 'the destiny of man' or<br>the 'triumph of human reason' without an<br>instant consciousness of the folly and brutality<br>they drag behind them\". For \"it is<br>almost impossible to think of a crime<br>that has not been committed in the<br>name of human reason\". Yet, he continues,<br>\"it would be unwise to simply abandon<br>the ground occupied by the historical humanisms.<br>For one thing humanism remains on many<br>occasions the only available alternative to bigotry<br>and persecution. The freedom to speak and<br>write, to organise and campaign in defence<br>of individual or collective interests, to protest<br>and disobey: all these can only be<br>articulated in humanist terms.\"",

The line from<br>a drama of Terence, Homo sum, humani<br>nihil a me alienum puto (or with<br>nil for nihil), meaning \"I am a<br>human being, I think nothing human alien<br>to me\", known since antiquity through the<br>endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency<br>as epitomising the humanist attitude.

          "<b>Dialect</b><br>The term dialect (from Latin dialectus, dialectos,<br>from the ancient Greek word διάλεκτος diálektos,<br>\"discourse\", from διά diá, \"through\" and λέγω<br>legō, \"I speak\") is used in two<br>distinct ways to refer to two different<br>types of linguistic phenomena.",
          "<b>Dialect</b><br>One usage—the more common among linguists—refers to<br>a variety of a language that is<br>a characteristic of a particular group of<br>the language's speakers. The term is applied<br>most often to regional speech patterns, but<br>a dialect may also be defined by<br>other factors, such as social class. A<br>dialect that is associated with a particular<br>social class can be termed a sociolect,<br>a dialect that is associated with a<br>particular ethnic group can be termed as<br>ethnolect, and a regional dialect may be<br>termed a regiolect. According to this definition,<br>any variety of a language constitutes \"a<br>dialect\", including any standard varieties.",
          "<b>Dialect</b><br>The other usage refers to a language<br>that is socially subordinated to a regional<br>or national standard language, often historically cognate<br>or related to the standard language, but<br>not actually derived from it. In this<br>sense, unlike in the first usage, the<br>standard language would not itself be considered<br>a \"dialect,\" as it is the dominant<br>language in a particular state or region,<br>whether in terms of social or political<br>status, official status, predominance or prevalence, or<br>all of the above. Meanwhile, the \"dialects\"<br>subordinate to the standard language are generally<br>not variations on the standard language but<br>rather separate (but often related) languages in<br>and of themselves. For example, most of<br>the various regional Romance languages of Italy,<br>often colloquially referred to as Italian \"dialects,\"<br>are, in fact, not actually derived from<br>modern standard Italian, but rather evolved from<br>Vulgar Latin separately and individually from one<br>another and independently of standard Italian, long<br>prior to the diffusion of a national<br>standardized language throughout what is now Italy.<br>These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore,<br>in a linguistic sense, not truly \"dialects\"<br>of the standard Italian language, but are<br>instead better defined as their own separate<br>languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard<br>Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century,<br>various regional versions or varieties of standard<br>Italian developed, generally as a mix of<br>the national standard Italian with local regional<br>languages and local accents. These variations on<br>standard Italian, known as regional Italian, would<br>more appropriately be called \"dialects\" in accordance<br>with the first linguistic definition of \"dialect,\"<br>as they are in fact derived partially<br>or mostly from standard Italian.",
          "<b>Dialect</b><br>A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary,<br>grammar, and pronunciation (phonology, including prosody). Where<br>a distinction can be made only in<br>terms of pronunciation (including prosody, or just<br>prosody itself), the term accent may be<br>preferred over dialect. Other types of speech<br>varieties include jargons, which are characterized by<br>differences in lexicon (vocabulary); slang; patois; pidgins;<br>and argots.",
          "<b>Dialect</b><br>A standard dialect (also known as a<br>standardized dialect or \"standard language\") is a<br>dialect that is supported by institutions. Such<br>institutional support may include government recognition or<br>designation; presentation as being the \"correct\" form<br>of a language in schools; published grammars,<br>dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a<br>correct spoken and written form; and an<br>extensive formal literature that employs that dialect<br>(prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be<br>multiple standard dialects associated with a single<br>language. For example, Standard American English, Standard<br>British English, Standard Canadian English, Standard Indian<br>English, Standard Australian English, and Standard Philippine<br>English may all be said to be<br>standard dialects of the English language.",
          "<b>Dialect</b><br>A nonstandard dialect, like a standard dialect,<br>has a complete vocabulary, grammar, and syntax,<br>but is usually not the beneficiary of<br>institutional support. Examples of a nonstandard English<br>dialect are Southern American English, Western Australian<br>English, Scouse and Tyke. The Dialect Test<br>was designed by Joseph Wright to compare<br>different English dialects with each other.",
          "<b>Dialect</b><br>There is no universally accepted criterion for<br>distinguishing two different languages from two dialects<br>(i.e. varieties) of the same language. A<br>number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading<br>to contradictory results. The distinction is therefore<br>subjective and depends on the user's frame<br>of reference. For example, there is discussion<br>about if the Limón Creole English must<br>be considered as \"a kind\" of English<br>or a different language. This creole is<br>spoken in the Caribbean coast of Costa<br>Rica (Central America) by descendant of Jamaican<br>people. The position that Costa Rican linguists<br>support depends on the University they belong.",
          "<b>Dialect</b><br>The most common, and most purely linguistic,<br>criterion is that of mutual intelligibility: two<br>varieties are said to be dialects of<br>the same language if being a speaker<br>of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to<br>understand and be understood by a speaker<br>of the other; otherwise, they are said<br>to be different languages. However, this definition<br>becomes problematic in the case of dialect<br>continua, in which it may be the<br>case that dialect B is mutually intelligible<br>with both dialect A and dialect C<br>but dialects A and C are not<br>mutually intelligible with each other. In this<br>case the criterion of mutual intelligibility makes<br>it impossible to decide whether A and<br>C are dialects of the same language<br>or not. Cases may also arise in<br>which a speaker of dialect X can<br>understand a speaker of dialect Y, but<br>not vice versa; the mutual intelligibility criterion<br>flounders here as well.",
          "<b>Dialect</b><br>Another occasionally used criterion for discriminating dialects<br>from languages is that of linguistic authority,<br>a more sociolinguistic notion. According to this<br>definition, two varieties are considered dialects of<br>the same language if (under at least<br>some circumstances) they would defer to the<br>same authority regarding some questions about their<br>language. For instance, to learn the name<br>of a new invention, or an obscure<br>foreign species of plant, speakers of Bavarian<br>German and East Franconian German might each<br>consult a German dictionary or ask a<br>German-speaking expert in the subject. By way<br>of contrast, although Yiddish is classified by<br>linguists as a language in the \"Middle<br>High German\" group of languages, a Yiddish<br>speaker would not consult a German dictionary<br>to determine the word to use in<br>such a case.",

Though<br>mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to<br>which the regional Italian languages are mutual<br>unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance<br>or geographical barriers between the languages, with<br>some regional Italian languages that are closer<br>in geographical proximity to each other or<br>closer to each other on the dialect<br>continuum being more or less mutually intelligible.<br>For instance, a speaker of purely Eastern<br>Lombard, a language in Northern Italy's Lombardy<br>region that includes the Bergamasque dialect, would<br>have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a<br>purely standard Italian speaker and would be<br>nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of<br>a pure Sicilian language variant. Due to<br>Eastern Lombard's status as a Gallo-Italic language,<br>an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact,<br>have more mutual intelligibility with a Occitan,<br>Catalan, or French speaker than a standard<br>Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a<br>Sicilian language speaker would have an greater<br>degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker<br>of the more closely related Neapolitan language,<br>but far less mutual intelligibility with a<br>person speaking Sicilian Gallo-Italic, a language that<br>developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on<br>the same island as the Sicilian language.",

With the eventual<br>spread of the radio and television throughout<br>Italy and the establishment of public education,<br>Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed<br>to standard Italian, while literacy rates among<br>all social classes improved.

During the 1850s, many clubs<br>unconnected to schools or universities were formed<br>throughout the English-speaking world, to play various<br>forms of football. Some came up with<br>their own distinct codes of rules, most<br>notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by<br>former public school pupils in 1857, which<br>led to formation of a Sheffield FA<br>in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring<br>of Uppingham School also devised an influential<br>set of rules.",
          "<b>Association_football</b><br>At a professional level, most matches produce<br>only a few goals. For example, the<br>2005–06 season of the English Premier League<br>produced an average of 2.48 goals per<br>match. The Laws of the Game do<br>not specify any player positions other than<br>goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles<br>have evolved. Broadly, these include three main<br>categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task<br>is to score goals; defenders, who specialise<br>in preventing their opponents from scoring; and<br>midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep<br>possession of the ball to pass it<br>to the forwards on their team. Players<br>in these positions are referred to as<br>outfield players, to distinguish them from the<br>goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according<br>to the area of the field in<br>which the player spends most time. For<br>example, there are central defenders, and left<br>and right midfielders. The ten outfield players<br>may be arranged in any combination. The<br>number of players in each position determines<br>the style of the team's play; more<br>forwards and fewer defenders creates a more<br>aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse<br>creates a slower, more defensive style of<br>play. While players typically spend most of<br>the game in a specific position, there<br>are few restrictions on player movement, and<br>players can switch positions at any time.<br>The layout of a team's players is<br>known as a formation. Defining the team's<br>formation and tactics is usually the prerogative<br>of the team's manager.",
          "<b>Association_football</b><br>These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation<br>of The Football Association (The FA) in<br>1863, which first met on the morning<br>of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons'<br>Tavern in Great Queen Street, London. The<br>only school to be represented on this<br>occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemason's Tavern was<br>the setting for five more meetings between<br>October and December, which eventually produced the<br>first comprehensive set of rules. At the<br>final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the<br>representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from<br>the FA over the removal of two<br>draft rules at the previous meeting: the<br>first allowed for running with the ball<br>in hand; the second for obstructing such<br>a run by hacking (kicking an opponent<br>in the shins), tripping and holding. Other<br>English rugby clubs followed this lead and<br>did not join the FA and instead<br>in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union.<br>The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge<br>of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to<br>ratify the original thirteen laws of the<br>game. These rules included handling of the<br>ball by \"marks\" and the lack of<br>a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably<br>similar to Victorian rules football being developed<br>at that time in Australia.

Dominic<br>needed a framework—a rule—to organize these components.<br>The Rule of St. Augustine was an<br>obvious choice for the Dominican Order, according<br>to Dominic's successor, Jordan of Saxony, because<br>it lent itself to the \"salvation of<br>souls through preaching\".

          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>Humbert of Romans, the master general of<br>the order from 1254 to 1263, was<br>a great administrator, as well as preacher<br>and writer. It was under his tenure<br>as master general that the sisters in<br>the order were given official membership. Humbert<br>was a great lover of languages, and<br>encouraged linguistic studies among the Dominicans, primarily<br>Arabic, because of the missionary work friars<br>were pursuing amongst those led astray or<br>forced to convert by Muslims in the<br>Middle East. He also wanted his friars<br>to reach excellence in their preaching, and<br>this was his most lasting contribution to<br>the order.

Humbert<br>advised his readers, \"[Young Dominicans] are also<br>to be instructed not to be eager<br>to see visions or work miracles, since<br>these avail little to salvation, and sometimes<br>we are fooled by them; but rather<br>they should be eager to do good<br>in which salvation consists. Also, they should<br>be taught not to be sad if<br>they do not enjoy the divine consolations<br>they hear others have; but they should<br>know the loving Father for some reason<br>sometimes withholds these.

          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>Another who contributed significantly to the spirituality<br>of the order is Albertus Magnus, the<br>only person of the period to be<br>given the appellation \"Great\". His influence on<br>the brotherhood permeated nearly every aspect of<br>Dominican life. Albert was a scientist, philosopher,<br>astrologer, theologian, spiritual writer, ecumenist, and diplomat.<br>Under the auspices of Humbert of Romans,<br>Albert molded the curriculum of studies for<br>all Dominican students, introduced Aristotle to the<br>classroom and probed the work of Neoplatonists,<br>such as Plotinus. Indeed, it was the<br>thirty years of work done by Thomas<br>Aquinas and himself (1245–1274) that allowed for<br>the inclusion of Aristotelian study in the<br>curriculum of Dominican schools.",
          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>One of Albert's greatest contributions was his<br>study of Dionysus the Areopagite, a mystical<br>theologian whose words left an indelible imprint<br>in the medieval period. Magnus' writings made<br>a significant contribution to German mysticism, which<br>became vibrant in the minds of the<br>Beguines and women such as Hildegard of<br>Bingen and Mechthild of Magdeburg. Mysticism, for<br>the purposes of this study, refers to<br>the conviction that all believers have the<br>capability to experience God's love. This love<br>may manifest itself through brief ecstatic experiences,<br>such that one may be engulfed by<br>God and gain an immediate knowledge of<br>Him, which is unknowable through the intellect<br>alone.",
          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>Albertus Magnus championed the idea, drawn from<br>Dionysus, that positive knowledge of God is<br>possible, but obscure. Thus, it is easier<br>to state what God is not, than<br>to state what God is: \"... we<br>affirm things of God only relatively, that<br>is, casually, whereas we deny things of<br>God absolutely, that is, with reference to<br>what He is in Himself. And there<br>is no contradiction between a relative affirmation<br>and an absolute negation. It is not<br>contradictory to say that someone is white-toothed<br>and not white\".",
          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>Albert the Great wrote that wisdom and<br>understanding enhance one's faith in God. According<br>to him, these are the tools that<br>God uses to commune with a contemplative.<br>Love in the soul is both the<br>cause and result of true understanding and<br>judgement. It causes not only an intellectual<br>knowledge of God, but a spiritual and<br>emotional knowledge as well. Contemplation is the<br>means whereby one can obtain this goal<br>of understanding. Things that once seemed static<br>and unchanging become full of possibility and<br>perfection. The contemplative then knows that God<br>is, but she does not know what<br>God is. Thus, contemplation forever produces a<br>mystified, imperfect knowledge of God. The soul<br>is exalted beyond the rest of God's<br>creation but it cannot see God Himself.",
          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>As the image of God grows within<br>man, he learns to rely less on<br>an intellectual pursuit of virtue and more<br>on an affective pursuit of charity and<br>meekness. Meekness and charity guide Christians to<br>acknowledge that they are nothing without the<br>One (God/Christ) who created them, sustains them,<br>and guides them. Thus, man then directs<br>his path to that One, and the<br>love for, and of, Christ guides man's<br>very nature to become centered on the<br>One, and on his neighbor as well.<br>Charity is the manifestation of the pure<br>love of Christ, both for and by<br>His follower.",
          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>The Dominican Order was affected by a<br>number of elemental influences. Its early members<br>imbued the order with a mysticism and<br>learning. The Europeans of the order embraced<br>ecstatic mysticism on a grand scale and<br>looked to a union with the Creator.<br>The English Dominicans looked for this complete<br>unity as well, but were not so<br>focused on ecstatic experiences. Instead, their goal<br>was to emulate the moral life of<br>Christ more completely. The Dartford nuns were<br>surrounded by all of these legacies, and<br>used them to create something unique.

          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>Although Albertus Magnus did much to instill<br>mysticism in the Order of Preachers, it<br>is a concept that reaches back to<br>the Hebrew Bible. In the tradition of<br>Holy Writ, the impossibility of coming face<br>to face with God is a recurring<br>motif, thus the commandment against graven images<br>(Exodus 20.4-5). As time passed, Jewish and<br>early Christian writings presented the idea of<br>'unknowing,' where God's presence was enveloped in<br>a dark cloud. These images arose out<br>of a confusing mass of ambiguous and<br>ambivalent statements regarding the nature of God<br>and man's relationship to Him.",
          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>Although Dominic and the early brethren had<br>instituted female Dominican houses at Prouille and<br>other places by 1227, some of the<br>brethren of the order had misgivings about<br>the necessity of female religious establishments in<br>an order whose major purpose was preaching,<br>a duty in which women could not<br>traditionally engage. In spite of these doubts,<br>women's houses dotted the countryside throughout Europe.<br>There were seventy-four Dominican female houses in<br>Germany, forty-two in Italy, nine in France,<br>eight in Spain, six in Bohemia, three<br>in Hungary, and three in Poland. Many<br>of the German religious houses that lodged<br>women had been home to communities of<br>women, such as Beguines, that became Dominican<br>once they were taught by the traveling<br>preachers and put under the jurisdiction of<br>the Dominican authoritative structure. A number of<br>these houses became centers of study and<br>mystical spirituality in the 14th century. There<br>were one hundred and fifty-seven nunneries in<br>the order by 1358.

The sisters<br>had no government of their own, but<br>lived under the authority of the general<br>and provincial chapters of the order. They<br>were compelled to obey all the rules<br>and shared in all the applicable privileges<br>of the order.

The clothing of the sisters consisted<br>of a white tunic and scapular, a<br>leather belt, a black mantle, and a<br>black veil.

          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>Because the nuns of the order did<br>not preach among the people, the need<br>to engage in study was not as<br>immediate or intense as it was for<br>men. They did participate, however, in a<br>number of intellectual activities. Along with sewing<br>and embroidery, nuns often engaged in reading<br>and discussing correspondence from Church leaders. In<br>the Strassburg monastery of St. Margaret, some<br>of the nuns could converse fluently in<br>Latin. Learning still had an elevated place<br>in the lives of these religious.

This was<br>an essential moral imitation of the Savior<br>as an ideal for religious change, and<br>as the means for reformation of humanity's<br>nature as an image of divinity. This<br>type of mysticism carried with it four<br>elements. First, spiritually it emulated the moral<br>essence of Christ's life. Second, there was<br>a connection linking moral emulation of Christ's<br>life and humanity's disposition as images of<br>the divine. Third, English Dominican mysticism focused<br>on an embodied spirituality with a structured<br>love of fellow men at its center.<br>Finally, the supreme aspiration of this mysticism<br>was either an ethical or an actual<br>union with God.",
          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>For English Dominican mystics, the mystical experience<br>was not expressed just in one moment<br>of the full knowledge of God, but<br>in the journey of, or process of,<br>faith. This then led to an understanding<br>that was directed toward an experiential knowledge<br>of divinity. It is important to understand,<br>however, that for these mystics it was<br>possible to pursue mystical life without the<br>visions and voices that are usually associated<br>with such a relationship with God. They<br>experienced a mystical process that allowed them,<br>in the end, to experience what they<br>had already gained knowledge of through their<br>faith only.",
          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>The center of all mystical experience is,<br>of course, Christ.

This led to a<br>\"progressive understanding of the meanings of Scripture--literal,<br>moral, allegorical, and anagogical\"—that was contained within<br>the mystical journey itself. From these considerations<br>of Scripture comes the simplest way to<br>imitate Christ: an emulation of the moral<br>actions and attitudes that Jesus demonstrated in<br>His earthly ministry becomes the most significant<br>way to feel and have knowledge of<br>God.",
          "<b>Dominican_Order</b><br>The English concentrated on the spirit of<br>the events of Christ's life, not the<br>literality of events.

They wanted to<br>create in themselves that environment that allowed<br>Jesus to fulfill His divine mission, insofar<br>as they were able. At the center<br>of this environment was love: the love<br>that Christ showed for humanity in becoming<br>human. Christ's love reveals the mercy of<br>God and His care for His creation.<br>English Dominican mystics sought through this love<br>to become images of God.

          "<b>Imperialism</b><br>Imperialism is a type of advocacy of<br>empire. Its name originated from the Latin<br>word \"imperium\", which means to rule over<br>large territories. Imperialism is \"a policy of<br>extending a country's power and influence through<br>colonization, use of military force, or other<br>means\". Imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary<br>world. It has also allowed for the<br>rapid spread of technologies and ideas. The<br>term imperialism has been applied to Western<br>(and Japanese) political and economic dominance especially<br>in Asia and Africa in the 19th<br>and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues<br>to be debated by scholars. Some writers,<br>such as Edward Said, use the term<br>more broadly to describe any system of<br>domination and subordination organised with an imperial<br>center and a periphery.",
          "<b>Imperialism</b><br>Imperialism is defined as \"A policy of<br>extending a country’s power and influence through<br>diplomacy or military force.\" Imperialism is particularly<br>focused on the control that one group,<br>often a state power, has on another<br>group of people. This is often through<br>various forms of \"othering\" (see other) based<br>on racial, religious, or cultural stereotypes. There<br>are \"formal\" or \"informal\" imperialisms. \"Formal imperialism\"<br>is defined as \"physical control or full-fledged<br>colonial rule\". \"Informal imperialism\" is less direct;<br>however, it is still a powerful form<br>of dominance.",
          "<b>Imperialism</b><br>The definition of imperialism has not been<br>finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen<br>to represent the policies of major powers,<br>or simply, general-purpose aggressiveness. Further on, some<br>writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly<br>more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds<br>of domination or control by a group<br>of people over another. To clear out<br>this confusion about the definition of imperialism<br>one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\"<br>imperialism, the first meaning physical control or<br>\"full-fledged colonial rule\" while the second implied<br>less direct rule though still containing perceivable<br>kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally<br>less costly than taking over territories formally.<br>This is because, with informal rule, the<br>control is spread more subtly through technological<br>superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts<br>that cannot be repaid, ownership of private<br>industries thus expanding the controlled area, or<br>having countries agree to uneven trade agreements<br>forcefully.",
          "<b>Imperialism</b><br>\"The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin<br>word imperium; for which the closest modern<br>English equivalent would perhaps be ‘sovereignty’, or<br>simply ‘rule’\". The greatest distinction of an<br>empire is through the amount of land<br>that a nation has conquered and expanded.<br>Political power grew from conquering land, however<br>cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea<br>and trade routes. A distinction about empires<br>is \"that although political empires were built<br>mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural<br>influences spread at least as much by<br>sea\". Some of the main aspects of<br>trade that went overseas consisted of animals<br>and plant products. European empires in Asia<br>and Africa \"have come to be seen<br>as the classic forms of imperialism: and<br>indeed most books on the subject confine<br>themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European<br>expansion caused the world to be divided<br>by how developed and developing nation are<br>portrayed through the world systems theory. The<br>two main regions are the core and<br>the periphery. The core consists of high<br>areas of income and profit; the periphery<br>is on the opposing side of the<br>spectrum consisting of areas of low income<br>and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics<br>have led to increased discussion of the<br>meaning and impact of imperialism on the<br>modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin<br>suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form<br>of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after<br>colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by<br>monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses<br>how important new political world order has<br>become in our modern era.

          "<b>Imperialism</b><br>The term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with<br>\"colonialism\", however many scholars have argued that<br>each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism<br>and colonialism have been used in order<br>to describe one's superiority, domination and influence<br>upon a person or group of people.<br>Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates<br>from the center, is a state policy<br>and is developed for ideological as well<br>as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the<br>development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism<br>in modern usage also tends to imply<br>a degree of geographic separation between the<br>colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward<br>Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and<br>colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice,<br>the theory and the attitudes of a<br>dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory',<br>while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of<br>settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land<br>empires such as the Russian or Ottoman<br>are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116<br>Thus it can be said that imperialism<br>includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism<br>itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as<br>it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]",
          "<b>Imperialism</b><br>Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political<br>and economic advantage over a land and<br>the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars<br>sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the<br>difference between the two. Although imperialism and<br>colonialism focus on the suppression of an<br>other, if colonialism refers to the process<br>of a country taking physical control of<br>another, imperialism refers to the political and<br>monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism<br>is seen to be the architect deciding<br>how to start dominating areas and then<br>imperialism can be seen as creating the<br>idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism<br>is when the imperial nation begins a<br>conquest over an area and then eventually<br>is able to rule over the areas<br>the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core<br>meaning is the exploitation of the valuable<br>assets and supplies of the nation that<br>was conquered and the conquering nation then<br>gaining the benefits from the spoils of<br>the war. The meaning of imperialism is<br>to create an empire, by conquering the<br>other state's lands and therefore increasing its<br>own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and<br>preserver of the colonial possessions in an<br>area by a population coming from a<br>foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the<br>existing social structure, physical structure and economics<br>of an area; it is not unusual<br>that the characteristics of the conquering peoples<br>are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.",

Many others argued<br>that imperialism is justified for several different<br>reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order<br>for a state to survive, imperialism was<br>needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain<br>needed to be one of the greatest<br>imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly<br>scientific nature of \"Social Darwinism\" and a<br>theory of races formed a supposedly rational<br>justification for imperialism.

Rather, by essentializing the<br>East, this discourse uses the idea of<br>place-based identities to create difference and distance<br>between \"we\" the West and \"them\" the<br>East, or \"here\" in the West and<br>\"there\" in the East. This difference was<br>particularly apparent in textual and visual works<br>of early European studies of the Orient<br>that positioned the East as irrational and<br>backward in opposition to the rational and<br>progressive West. Defining the East as a<br>negative vision of itself, as its inferior,<br>not only increased the West’s sense of<br>self, but also was a way of<br>ordering the East and making it known<br>to the West so that it could<br>be dominated and controlled. The discourse of<br>Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification<br>of early Western imperialism, as it formed<br>a body of knowledge and ideas that<br>rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control<br>of other territories.",

          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>Given the potential consequences, engaging in sexual<br>behavior is somewhat risky, particularly for adolescents.<br>Having unprotected sex, using poor birth control<br>methods (e.g. withdrawal), having multiple sexual partners,<br>and poor communication are some aspects of<br>sexual behavior that increase individual and/or social<br>risk. Some qualities of adolescents' lives that<br>are often correlated with risky sexual behavior<br>include higher rates of experienced abuse, lower<br>rates of parental support and monitoring. Adolescence<br>is also commonly a time of questioning<br>sexuality and gender. This may involve intimate<br>experimentation with people identifying as the same<br>gender as well as with people of<br>differing genders.

Some have<br>argued that there may be evolutionary benefits<br>to an increased propensity for risk-taking in<br>adolescence. For example, without a willingness to<br>take risks, teenagers would not have the<br>motivation or confidence necessary to leave their<br>family of origin. In addition, from a<br>population perspective, there is an advantage to<br>having a group of individuals willing to<br>take more risks and try new methods,<br>counterbalancing the more conservative elements more typical<br>of the received knowledge held by older<br>adults.

          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>Identity development is a stage in the<br>adolescent life cycle. For most, the search<br>for identity begins in the adolescent years.<br>During these years, adolescents are more open<br>to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances<br>to discover who they are. In other<br>words, in an attempt to find their<br>identity and discover who they are adolescents<br>are liking to cycle through a number<br>of identities to find one that suits<br>them best. But, developing and maintaining identity<br>(in adolescent years) is a difficult task<br>due to multiple factors such as family<br>life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies<br>suggest that this process might be more<br>accurately described as identity development, rather than<br>formation, but confirms a normative process of<br>change in both content and structure of<br>one's thoughts about the self. The two<br>main aspects of identity development are self-clarity<br>and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent<br>years can influence later life, high levels<br>of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will<br>lead to better decisions during the transition<br>to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three<br>general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept,<br>sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years<br>of adolescence create a more conscientious group<br>of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention<br>and give more time and effort to<br>their appearance as their body goes through<br>changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an<br>effort to look presentable (1991). The environment<br>in which an adolescent grows up also<br>plays an important role in their identity<br>development. Studies done by the American Psychological<br>Association have shown that adolescents with a<br>less privileged upbringing have a more difficult<br>time developing their identity.",
          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>Research since reveals self-examination beginning early in<br>adolescence, but identity achievement rarely occurring before<br>age 18. The freshman year of college<br>influences identity development significantly, but may actually<br>prolong psychosocial moratorium by encouraging reexamination of<br>previous commitments and further exploration of alternate<br>possibilities without encouraging resolution. For the most<br>part, evidence has supported Erikson's stages: each<br>correlates with the personality traits he originally<br>predicted.

          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire<br>to feel important in their peer groups<br>and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting<br>aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent<br>sense of self stable across circumstances and<br>including past experiences and future goals. Everyone<br>has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued<br>that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's<br>theory of stages of development includes the<br>identity crisis in which adolescents must explore<br>different possibilities and integrate different parts of<br>themselves before committing to their beliefs. He<br>described the resolution of this process as<br>a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also<br>stressed that the identity challenge \"is never<br>fully resolved once and for all at<br>one point in time\". Adolescents begin by<br>defining themselves based on their crowd membership.<br>\"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate<br>from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion<br>has played a major role when it<br>comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion<br>is always evolving, which corresponds with the<br>evolution of change in the personality of<br>teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity<br>by consciously styling themselves in different manners<br>to find what best suits them.

Researcher James Marcia developed the current<br>method for testing an individual's progress along<br>these stages. His questions are divided into<br>three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships.<br>Answers are scored based on extent to<br>which the individual has explored and the<br>degree to which he has made commitments.<br>The result is classification of the individual<br>into a) identity diffusion in which all<br>children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which<br>commitments are made without the exploration of<br>alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of<br>exploration, or d) Identity Achievement in which<br>Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments.",
          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>The final major aspect of identity formation<br>is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's<br>thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and<br>identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that<br>there is a grand desire, across all<br>genders and ages, to maintain, protect and<br>enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief,<br>there is no empirical evidence for a<br>significant drop in self-esteem over the course<br>of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and<br>can cause severe distress and anxiety, but<br>baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence.<br>The validity of global self-esteem scales has<br>been questioned, and many suggest that more<br>specific scales might reveal more about the<br>adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to<br>enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive<br>relationships with friends, the most important function<br>of friendship to them is having someone<br>who can provide social and moral support.<br>When they fail to win friends' approval<br>or couldn't find someone with whom to<br>share common activities and common interests, in<br>these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem.<br>In contrast, boys are more concerned with<br>establishing and asserting their independence and defining<br>their relation to authority. As such, they<br>are more likely to derive high self-esteem<br>from their ability to successfully influence their<br>friends; on the other hand, the lack<br>of romantic competence, for example, failure to<br>win or maintain the affection of the<br>opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation),<br>is the major contributor to low self-esteem<br>in adolescent boys. Due to the fact<br>that both men and women happen to<br>have a low self-esteem after ending a<br>romantic relationship, they are prone to other<br>symptoms that is caused by this state.<br>Depression and hopelessness are only two of<br>the various symptoms and it is said<br>that women are twice as likely to<br>experience depression and men are three to<br>four times more likely to commit suicide<br>(Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).",
          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>In terms of sexual identity, adolescence is<br>when most gay/lesbian and transgender adolescents begin<br>to recognize and make sense of their<br>feelings. Many adolescents may choose to come<br>out during this period of their life<br>once an identity has been formed; many<br>others may go through a period of<br>questioning or denial, which can include experimentation<br>with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences. A<br>study of 194 lesbian, gay, and bisexual<br>youths under the age of 21 found<br>that having an awareness of one's sexual<br>orientation occurred, on average, around age 10,<br>but the process of coming out to<br>peers and adults occurred around age 16<br>and 17, respectively. Coming to terms with<br>and creating a positive LGBT identity can<br>be difficult for some youth for a<br>variety of reasons. Peer pressure is a<br>large factor when youth who are questioning<br>their sexuality or gender identity are surrounded<br>by heteronormative peers and can cause great<br>distress due to a feeling of being<br>different from everyone else. While coming out<br>can also foster better psychological adjustment, the<br>risks associated are real. Indeed, coming out<br>in the midst of a heteronormative peer<br>environment often comes with the risk of<br>ostracism, hurtful jokes, and even violence.

          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>A potential important influence on adolescence is<br>change of the family dynamic, specifically divorce.<br>With the divorce rate up to about<br>50%, divorce is common and adds to<br>the already great amount of change in<br>adolescence. Custody disputes soon after a divorce<br>often reflect a playing out of control<br>battles and ambivalence between parents.

A parental divorce during childhood<br>or adolescence continues to have a negative<br>effect when a person is in his<br>or her twenties and early thirties.

          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>Romantic relationships tend to increase in prevalence<br>throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of<br>adolescents have had a romantic relationship that<br>lasted at least one month over the<br>course of the previous 18 months. In<br>a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for<br>Channel 4, 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed<br>that they had their first sexual experience<br>at 13 or under in the United<br>Kingdom.

The<br>typical duration of relationships increases throughout the<br>teenage years as well. This constant increase<br>in the likelihood of a long-term relationship<br>can be explained by sexual maturation and<br>the development of cognitive skills necessary to<br>maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate<br>attachment), although these skills are not strongly<br>developed until late adolescence.

However, \"culture\" should not be seen<br>as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many<br>cultures are present within any given country<br>and racial or socioeconomic group.

          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>The formal study of adolescent psychology began<br>with the publication of G. Stanley Hall's<br>\"Adolescence in 1904.\" Hall, who was the<br>first president of the American Psychological Association,<br>viewed adolescence primarily as a time of<br>internal turmoil and upheaval (sturm und drang).<br>This understanding of youth was based on<br>two then new ways of understanding human<br>behavior: Darwin's evolutionary theory and Freud's psychodynamic<br>theory. He believed that adolescence was a<br>representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift<br>from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's<br>assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s<br>when psychologists such as Erik Erikson and<br>Anna Freud started to formulate their theories<br>about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological<br>disturbances associated with youth were biologically based<br>and culturally universal while Erikson focused on<br>the dichotomy between identity formation and role<br>fulfillment. Even with their different theories, these<br>three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently<br>a time of disturbance and psychological confusion.<br>The less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such<br>as peer relations and cultural influence, were<br>left largely ignored until the 1980s. From<br>the '50s until the '80s, the focus<br>of the field was mainly on describing<br>patterns of behavior as opposed to explaining<br>them.",
          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>The idea of self-concept is known as<br>the ability of a person to have<br>opinions and beliefs that are defined confidently,<br>consistent and stable. Early in adolescence, cognitive<br>developments result in greater self-awareness, greater awareness<br>of others and their thoughts and judgments,<br>the ability to think about abstract, future<br>possibilities, and the ability to consider multiple<br>possibilities at once. As a result, adolescents<br>experience a significant shift from the simple,<br>concrete, and global self-descriptions typical of young<br>children; as children, they defined themselves by<br>physical traits whereas as adolescents, they define<br>themselves based on their values, thoughts, and<br>opinions.",
          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>An adolescent's environment plays a huge role<br>in their identity development. While most adolescent<br>studies are conducted on white, middle class<br>children, studies show that the more privileged<br>upbringing people have, the more successfully they<br>develop their identity. The forming of an<br>adolescent's identity is a crucial time in<br>their life. It has been recently found<br>that demographic patterns suggest that the transition<br>to adulthood is now occurring over a<br>longer span of years than was the<br>case during the middle of the 20th<br>century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans<br>late adolescence and early adulthood, has become<br>a more prominent stage of the life<br>course. This therefore has caused various factors<br>to become important during this development. So<br>many factors contribute to the developing social<br>identity of an adolescent from commitment, to<br>coping devices, to social media. All of<br>these factors are affected by the environment<br>an adolescent grows up in. A child<br>from a more privileged upbringing is exposed<br>to more opportunities and better situations in<br>general. An adolescent from an inner city<br>or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely<br>to be exposed to an environment that<br>can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence<br>is a sensitive period in the development<br>process, and exposure to the wrong things<br>at that time can have a major<br>effect on future decisions. While children that<br>grow up in nice suburban communities are<br>not exposed to bad environments they are<br>more likely to participate in activities that<br>can benefit their identity and contribute to<br>a more successful identity development.",
          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>The relationships adolescents have with their peers,<br>family, and members of their social sphere<br>play a vital role in the social<br>development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's<br>social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish<br>the differences between friends and acquaintances, they<br>often become heavily emotionally invested in friends.<br>This is not harmful; however, if these<br>friends expose an individual to potentially harmful<br>situations, this is an aspect of peer<br>pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in<br>social development because adolescents can be easily<br>influenced by the people they develop close<br>relationships with. This is the first time<br>individuals can truly make their own decisions,<br>which also makes this a sensitive period.<br>Relationships are vital in the social development<br>of an adolescent due to the extreme<br>influence peers can have over an individual.<br>These relationships become significant because they begin<br>to help the adolescent understand the concept<br>of personalities, how they form and why<br>a person has that specific type of<br>personality. \"The use of psychological comparisons could<br>serve both as an index of the<br>growth of an implicit personality theory and<br>as a component process accounting for its<br>creation.

In social<br>comparison we use reference groups, with respect<br>to both psychological and identity development. These<br>reference groups are the peers of adolescents.<br>This means that who the teen chooses/accepts<br>as their friends and who they communicate<br>with on a frequent basis often makes<br>up their reference groups and can therefore<br>have a huge impact on who they<br>become.

          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>Peer groups are essential to social and<br>general development.

High quality<br>friendships may enhance children's development regardless of<br>the characteristics of those friends. As children<br>begin to bond with various people and<br>create friendships, it later helps them when<br>they are adolescent and sets up the<br>framework for adolescence and peer groups. Peer<br>groups are especially important during adolescence, a<br>period of development characterized by a dramatic<br>increase in time spent with peers and<br>a decrease in adult supervision. Adolescents also<br>associate with friends of the opposite sex<br>much more than in childhood and tend<br>to identify with larger groups of peers<br>based on shared characteristics. It is also<br>common for adolescents to use friends as<br>coping devices in different situations.

Sexual events (such as<br>sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common<br>than romantic events (holding hands) and social<br>events (being with one's partner in a<br>group setting).

          "<b>Adolescence</b><br>The degree to which adolescents are perceived<br>as autonomous beings varies widely by culture,<br>as do the behaviors that represent this<br>emerging autonomy. Psychologists have identified three main<br>types of autonomy: emotional independence, behavioral autonomy,<br>and cognitive autonomy. Emotional autonomy is defined<br>in terms of an adolescent's relationships with<br>others, and often includes the development of<br>more mature emotional connections with adults and<br>peers. Behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent's developing<br>ability to regulate his or her own<br>behavior, to act on personal decisions, and<br>to self-govern. Cultural differences are especially visible<br>in this category because it concerns issues<br>of dating, social time with peers, and<br>time-management decisions. Cognitive autonomy describes the capacity<br>for an adolescent to partake in processes<br>of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive<br>reliance on social validation. Converging influences from<br>adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an<br>increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of<br>more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of<br>autonomy for adolescents. Proper development of autonomy<br>has been tied to good mental health,<br>high self-esteem, self-motivated tendencies, positive self-concepts, and<br>self-initiating and regulating behaviors.

The CA1 neurons found in the<br>hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing<br>the release of glucose and the reuptake<br>of glutamate. This high level of extracellular<br>glutamate allow calcium to enter NMDA receptors<br>which in return kills neurons. Stressful life<br>experiences can also cause repression of memories<br>where a person moves an unbearable memory<br>to the unconscious mind.

          "<b>Memory</b><br>Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall<br>while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has<br>the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During<br>sleep, the neural connections in the brain<br>are strengthened. This enhances the brain’s abilities<br>to stabilize and retain memories. There have<br>been several studies which show that sleep<br>improves the retention of memory, as memories<br>are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation<br>takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This<br>process implicates that memories are reactivated during<br>sleep, but that the process doesn’t enhance<br>every memory. It also implicates that qualitative<br>changes are made to the memories when<br>they are transferred to long-term store during<br>sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus<br>replays the events of the day for<br>the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and<br>processes memories, which moves them into long-term<br>memory. When you do not get enough<br>sleep it makes it more difficult to<br>learn as these neural connections are not<br>as strong, resulting in a lower retention<br>rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it<br>harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning.<br>Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep<br>deprivation can lead to false memories as<br>the memories are not properly transferred to<br>long-term memory. Therefore, it is important to<br>get the proper amount of sleep so<br>that memory can function at the highest<br>level. One of the primary functions of<br>sleep is thought to be the improvement<br>of the consolidation of information, as several<br>studies have demonstrated that memory depends on<br>getting sufficient sleep between training and test.<br>Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have<br>shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain<br>that mirror those recorded during the learning<br>of tasks from the previous day, suggesting<br>that new memories may be solidified through<br>such rehearsal.",

          "<b>Memory</b><br>Much of the current knowledge of memory<br>has come from studying memory disorders, particularly<br>amnesia. Loss of memory is known as<br>amnesia. Amnesia can result from extensive damage<br>to: (a) the regions of the medial<br>temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, dentate<br>gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and<br>perirhinal cortices or the (b) midline diencephalic<br>region, specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the<br>thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the<br>hypothalamus. There are many sorts of amnesia,<br>and by studying their different forms, it<br>has become possible to observe apparent defects<br>in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory<br>systems, and thus hypothesize their function in<br>the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders<br>such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease<br>can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia,<br>or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that<br>affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning<br>that they cannot forget small details that<br>otherwise would not be stored. Korsakoff's syndrome,<br>also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome,<br>is an organic brain disease that adversely<br>affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage<br>of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.",

          "<b>Memory</b><br>However, memory performance can be enhanced when<br>material is linked to the learning context,<br>even when learning occurs under stress. A<br>separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and<br>Wolf shows that when retention testing is<br>done in a context similar to or<br>congruent with the original learning task (i.e.,<br>in the same room), memory impairment and<br>the detrimental effects of stress on learning<br>can be attenuated. Seventy-two healthy female and<br>male university students, randomly assigned to the<br>SECPT stress test or to a control<br>group, were asked to remember the locations<br>of 15 pairs of picture cards –<br>a computerized version of the card game<br>\"Concentration\" or \"Memory\".

The memory performance of<br>subjects who experienced stress during the object-location<br>task decreased significantly when they were tested<br>in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla<br>scent (an incongruent context); however, the memory<br>performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment<br>when they were tested in the original<br>room with the vanilla scent (a congruent<br>context).

          "<b>Memory</b><br>Interestingly, research has revealed that asking individuals<br>to repeatedly imagine actions that they have<br>never performed or events that they have<br>never experienced could result in false memories.<br>For instance, Goff and Roediger (1998) asked<br>participants to imagine that they performed an<br>act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then<br>later asked them whether they had done<br>such a thing.

People can construct their<br>memories when they encode them and/or when<br>they recall them. To illustrate, consider a<br>classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and<br>John Palmer (1974) in which people were<br>instructed to watch a film of a<br>traffic accident and then asked about what<br>they saw. The researchers found that the<br>people who were asked, \"How fast were<br>the cars going when they smashed into<br>each other?\" gave higher estimates than those<br>who were asked, \"How fast were the<br>cars going when they hit each other?\"<br>Furthermore, when asked a week later whether<br>they have seen broken glass in the<br>film, those who had been asked the<br>question with smashed were twice more likely<br>to report that they have seen broken<br>glass than those who had been asked<br>the question with hit. There was no<br>broken glass depicted in the film. Thus,<br>the wording of the questions distorted viewers’<br>memories of the event. Importantly, the wording<br>of the question led people to construct<br>different memories of the event – those<br>who were asked the question with smashed<br>recalled a more serious car accident than<br>they had actually seen. The findings of<br>this experiment were replicated around the world,<br>and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people<br>were provided with misleading information they tended<br>to misremember, a phenomenon known as the<br>misinformation effect.",

They<br>were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from<br>\"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland<br>and Norway who, under their leader Rollo,<br>agreed to swear fealty to King Charles<br>III of West Francia. Through generations of<br>assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish<br>and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually<br>merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West<br>Francia.

They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of<br>the Frankish land they settled, their dialect<br>becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman<br>French, an important literary language. The Duchy<br>of Normandy, which they formed by treaty<br>with the French crown, was a great<br>fief of medieval France, and under Richard<br>I of Normandy was forged into a<br>cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure.<br>The Normans are noted both for their<br>culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture<br>and musical traditions, and for their significant<br>military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded<br>the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II<br>after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens<br>and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf<br>of their duke, William the Conqueror, led<br>to the Norman conquest of England at<br>the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

          "<b>Ctenophora</b><br>The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically<br>fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\"), although a<br>few genera have simple tentacles without these<br>sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely<br>covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey<br>by sticking to it.

          "<b>Ctenophora</b><br>Development of the fertilized eggs is direct,<br>in other words there is no distinctive<br>larval form, and juveniles of all groups<br>generally resemble miniature cydippid adults. In the<br>genus Beroe the juveniles, like the adults,<br>lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths. In most<br>species the juveniles gradually develop the body<br>forms of their parents. In some groups,<br>such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the<br>juveniles behave more like true larvae, as<br>they live among the plankton and thus<br>occupy a different ecological niche from their<br>parents and attain the adult form by<br>a more radical metamorphosis, after dropping to<br>the sea-floor.",

          "<b>Ctenophora</b><br>Almost all ctenophores are predators – there<br>are no vegetarians and only one genus<br>that is partly parasitic. If food is<br>plentiful, they can eat 10 times their<br>own weight per day. While Beroe preys<br>mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species<br>prey on zooplankton (planktonic animals) ranging in<br>size from the microscopic, including mollusc and<br>fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such<br>as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. Members<br>of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish<br>and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells)<br>into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts.<br>Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in<br>their wide range of techniques from capturing<br>prey – some hang motionless in the<br>water using their tentacles as \"webs\", some<br>are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders,<br>and some dangle a sticky droplet at<br>the end of a fine thread, as<br>bolas spiders do. This variety explains the<br>wide range of body forms in a<br>phylum with rather few species. The two-tentacled<br>\"cydippid\" Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close<br>relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like<br>floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach<br>themselves like parasites to salps that are<br>too large for them to swallow. Members<br>of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the<br>lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities<br>at the same place and time because<br>they specialize in different types of prey:<br>Pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong<br>swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis<br>generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such<br>as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.",
          "<b>Ctenophora</b><br>Ctenophores used to be regarded as \"dead<br>ends\" in marine food chains because it<br>was thought their low ratio of organic<br>matter to salt and water made them<br>a poor diet for other animals. It<br>is also often difficult to identify the<br>remains of ctenophores in the guts of<br>possible predators, although the combs sometimes remain<br>intact long enough to provide a clue.<br>Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta,<br>showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20<br>times as fast as an equal weight<br>of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide<br>a good diet if there are enough<br>of them around. Beroids prey mainly on<br>other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat<br>large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may<br>temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores<br>and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations<br>in population, most fish that prey on<br>them are generalists, and may have a<br>greater effect on populations than the specialist<br>jelly-eaters. This is underlined by an observation<br>of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous<br>zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea.<br>The larvae of some sea anemones are<br>parasites on ctenophores, as are the larvae<br>of some flatworms that parasitize fish when<br>they reach adulthood.",
          "<b>Ctenophora</b><br>On the other hand, in the late<br>1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi<br>was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea<br>and Sea of Azov via the ballast<br>tanks of ships, and has been blamed<br>for causing sharp drops in fish catches<br>by eating both fish larvae and small<br>crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult<br>fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade<br>new territories (although this was not predicted<br>until after it so successfully colonized the<br>Black Sea), as it can breed very<br>rapidly and tolerate a wide range of<br>water temperatures and salinities. The impact was<br>increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication<br>that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term<br>boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase<br>even faster than normal – and above<br>all by the absence of efficient predators<br>on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in<br>those areas were eventually brought under control<br>by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating<br>North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by<br>a cooling of the local climate from<br>1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the<br>animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton<br>in the area seems unlikely to be<br>restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.",

Until the mid-1990s only<br>two specimens good enough for analysis were<br>known, both members of the crown group,<br>from the early Devonian (Emsian) period.

Ctenophores have been purported to be<br>the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister<br>to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa<br>and Bilateria, and sister to all other<br>animal phyla. A series of studies that<br>looked at the presence and absence of<br>members of gene families and signalling pathways<br>(e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling<br>pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent<br>with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores<br>are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and<br>Bilateria or sister to all other animal<br>phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete<br>sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced<br>animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as<br>the sister lineage to all other animals.<br>This position would suggest that neural and<br>muscle cell types were either lost in<br>major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that<br>they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage.<br>However, other researchers have argued that the<br>placement of Ctenophora as sister to all<br>other animals is a statistical anomaly caused<br>by the high rate of evolution in<br>ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is<br>the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead.

          "<b>Ctenophora</b><br>Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids<br>have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been<br>assumed that their last common ancestor also<br>resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped body and<br>a pair of retractable tentacles. Richard Harbison's<br>purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that<br>the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other<br>words do not contain all and only<br>the descendants of a single common ancestor<br>that was itself a cydippid. Instead he<br>found that various cydippid families were more<br>similar to members of other ctenophore orders<br>than to other cydippids.

A<br>molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26<br>species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed<br>that the cydippids are not monophyletic and<br>concluded that the last common ancestor of<br>modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found<br>that the genetic differences between these species<br>were very small – so small that<br>the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and<br>Thalassocalycida remained uncertain.

Desperate to keep West from<br>defecting to another label, then-label head Damon<br>Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records.<br>Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially<br>reluctant to support West as a rapper,<br>claiming that many saw him as a<br>producer first and foremost, and that his<br>background contrasted with that of his labelmates.",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>West's breakthrough came a year later on<br>October 23, 2002, when, while driving home<br>from a California recording studio after working<br>late, he fell asleep at the wheel<br>and was involved in a near-fatal car<br>crash. The crash left him with a<br>shattered jaw, which had to be wired<br>shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired<br>West; two weeks after being admitted to<br>the hospital, he recorded a song at<br>the Record Plant Studios with his jaw<br>still wired shut. The composition, \"Through The<br>Wire\", expressed West's experience after the accident,<br>and helped lay the foundation for his<br>debut album, as according to West \"all<br>the better artists have expressed what they<br>were going through\". West added that \"the<br>album was my medicine\", as working on<br>the record distracted him from the pain.<br>\"Through The Wire\" was first available on<br>West's Get Well Soon... mixtape, released December<br>2002. At the same time, West announced<br>that he was working on an album<br>called The College Dropout, whose overall theme<br>was to \"make your own decisions. Don't<br>let society tell you, 'This is what<br>you have to do.'\"",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>Carrying a Louis Vuitton backpack filled with<br>old disks and demos to the studio<br>and back, West crafted much of his<br>production for his debut album in less<br>than fifteen minutes at a time. He<br>recorded the remainder of the album in<br>Los Angeles while recovering from the car<br>accident. Once he had completed the album,<br>it was leaked months before its release<br>date. However, West decided to use the<br>opportunity to review the album, and The<br>College Dropout was significantly remixed, remastered, and<br>revised before being released. As a result,<br>certain tracks originally destined for the album<br>were subsequently retracted, among them \"Keep the<br>Receipt\" with Ol' Dirty Bastard and \"The<br>Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" with<br>Consequence. West meticulously refined the production, adding<br>string arrangements, gospel choirs, improved drum programming<br>and new verses. West's perfectionism led The<br>College Dropout to have its release postponed<br>three times from its initial date in<br>August 2003.",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>The College Dropout was eventually issued by<br>Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number<br>two on the Billboard 200 as his<br>debut single, \"Through the Wire\" peaked at<br>number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100<br>chart for five weeks. \"Slow Jamz\", his<br>second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx,<br>became an even bigger success: it became<br>the three musicians' first number one hit.<br>The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim<br>from contemporary music critics, was voted the<br>top album of the year by two<br>major music publications, and has consistently been<br>ranked among the great hip-hop works and<br>debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the<br>album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to<br>a wider audience; the song's subject matter<br>concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless<br>reached the top 20 of the Billboard<br>pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that<br>a song containing such blatant declarations of<br>faith would never make it to radio.<br>The College Dropout would eventually be certified<br>triple platinum in the US, and garnered<br>West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of<br>the Year, and Best Rap Album (which<br>it received). During this period, West also<br>founded GOOD Music, a record label and<br>management company that would go on to<br>house affiliate artists and producers, such as<br>No I.D. and John Legend. At the<br>time, the focal point of West's production<br>style was the use of sped-up vocal<br>samples from soul records. However, partly because<br>of the acclaim of The College Dropout,<br>such sampling had been much copied by<br>others; with that overuse, and also because<br>West felt he had become too dependent<br>on the technique, he decided to find<br>a new sound.",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>Beginning his second effort that fall, West<br>would invest two million dollars and take<br>over a year to craft his second<br>album. West was significantly inspired by Roseland<br>NYC Live, a 1998 live album by<br>English trip hop group Portishead, produced with<br>the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in<br>his career, the live album had inspired<br>him to incorporate string arrangements into his<br>hip-hop production. Though West had not been<br>able to afford many live instruments around<br>the time of his debut album, the<br>money from his commercial success enabled him<br>to hire a string orchestra for his<br>second album Late Registration. West collaborated with<br>American film score composer Jon Brion, who<br>served as the album's co-executive producer for<br>several tracks. Although Brion had no prior<br>experience in creating hip-hop records, he and<br>West found that they could productively work<br>together after their first afternoon in the<br>studio where they discovered that neither confined<br>his musical knowledge and vision to one<br>specific genre. Late Registration sold over 2.3<br>million units in the United States alone<br>by the end of 2005 and was<br>considered by industry observers as the only<br>successful major album release of the fall<br>season, which had been plagued by steadily<br>declining CD sales.",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>While West had encountered controversy a year<br>prior when he stormed out of the<br>American Music Awards of 2004 after losing<br>Best New Artist, the rapper's first large-scale<br>controversy came just days following Late Registration's<br>release, during a benefit concert for Hurricane<br>Katrina victims. In September 2005, NBC broadcast<br>A Concert for Hurricane Relief, and West<br>was a featured speaker. When West was<br>presenting alongside actor Mike Myers, he deviated<br>from the prepared script. Myers spoke next<br>and continued to read the script. Once<br>it was West's turn to speak again,<br>he said, \"George Bush doesn't care about<br>black people.\" West's comment reached much of<br>the United States, leading to mixed reactions;<br>President Bush would later call it one<br>of the most \"disgusting moments\" of his<br>presidency. West raised further controversy in January<br>2006 when he posed on the cover<br>of Rolling Stone wearing a crown of<br>thorns.",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>Fresh off spending the previous year touring<br>the world with U2 on their Vertigo<br>Tour, West felt inspired to compose anthemic<br>rap songs that could operate more efficiently<br>in large arenas. To this end, West<br>incorporated the synthesizer into his hip-hop production,<br>utilized slower tempos, and experimented with electronic<br>music and influenced by music of the<br>1980s. In addition to U2, West drew<br>musical inspiration from arena rock bands such<br>as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin<br>in terms of melody and chord progression.<br>To make his next effort, the third<br>in a planned tetralogy of education-themed studio<br>albums, more introspective and personal in lyricism,<br>West listened to folk and country singer-songwriters<br>Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes<br>of developing methods to augment his wordplay<br>and storytelling ability.",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>West's third studio album, Graduation, garnered major<br>publicity when its release date pitted West<br>in a sales competition against rapper 50<br>Cent's Curtis. Upon their September 2007 releases,<br>Graduation outsold Curtis by a large margin,<br>debuting at number one on the U.S.<br>Billboard 200 chart and selling 957,000 copies<br>in its first week. Graduation once again<br>continued the string of critical and commercial<br>successes by West, and the album's lead<br>single, \"Stronger\", garnered the rapper his third<br>number-one hit. \"Stronger\", which samples French house<br>duo Daft Punk, has been accredited to<br>not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to<br>incorporate house and electronica elements into their<br>music, but also for playing a part<br>in the revival of disco and electro-infused<br>music in the late 2000s. Ben Detrick<br>of XXL cited the outcome of the<br>sales competition between 50 Cent's Curtis and<br>West's Graduation as being responsible for altering<br>the direction of hip-hop and paving the<br>way for new rappers who didn't follow<br>the hardcore-gangster mold, writing, \"If there was<br>ever a watershed moment to indicate hip-hop's<br>changing direction, it may have come when<br>50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007<br>to see whose album would claim superior<br>sales.\"",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>West's life took a different direction when<br>his mother, Donda West, died of complications<br>from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast<br>reduction in November 2007.

While it<br>was criticized prior to release, 808s &<br>Heartbreak had a significant effect on hip-hop<br>music, encouraging other rappers to take more<br>creative risks with their productions.",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>In 2012, Rolling Stone journalist Matthew Trammell<br>asserted that the record was ahead of<br>its time and wrote, \"Now that popular<br>music has finally caught up to it,<br>808s & Heartbreak has revealed itself to<br>be Kanye’s most vulnerable work, and perhaps<br>his most brilliant.\"",
          "<b>Kanye_West</b><br>West's controversial incident the following year at<br>the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was<br>arguably his biggest controversy, and led to<br>widespread outrage throughout the music industry.

The record included the international<br>hit \"All of the Lights\", and Billboard<br>hits \"Power\", \"Monster\", and \"Runaway\", the latter<br>of which accompanied a 35-minute film of<br>the same name.

By employing<br>a sales strategy that released the album<br>digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, Watch<br>the Throne became one of the few<br>major label albums in the Internet age<br>to avoid a leak. \"Niggas in Paris\"<br>became the record's highest charting single, peaking<br>at number five on the Billboard Hot<br>100. In 2012, West released the compilation<br>album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks<br>by artists from West's record label GOOD<br>Music.

Drawing inspiration from<br>artists such as Gary Numan, TJ Swan<br>and Boy George, and maintaining a \"minimal<br>but functional\" approach towards the album's studio<br>production, West explored the electronic feel produced<br>by Auto-Tune and utilized the sounds created<br>by the 808, manipulating its pitch to<br>produce a distorted, electronic sound; he then<br>sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the<br>traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir<br>monks. The album's music features austere production<br>and elements such as dense drums, lengthy<br>strings, droning synthesizers, and somber piano, and<br>drew comparisons to the work of 1980s<br>post-punk and new wave groups, with West<br>himself later confessing an affinity with British<br>post-punk group Joy Division.

Some basic emotions can<br>be modified to form complex emotions.

Some people may<br>believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific<br>actions: e.g. \"I'm crying because I'm sad,\"<br>or \"I ran away because I was<br>scared.\" The issue with the James–Lange theory<br>is that of causation (bodily states causing<br>emotions and being a priori), not that<br>of the bodily influences on emotional experience<br>(which can be argued and is still<br>quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and<br>embodiment theory).",

In this respect, emotions<br>are held to be analogous to faculties<br>such as vision or touch, which provide<br>information about the relation between the subject<br>and the world in various ways.

          "<b>Emotion</b><br>A common way in which emotions are<br>conceptualized in sociology is in terms of<br>the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional<br>labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological<br>changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse<br>rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g.,<br>smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of<br>situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional<br>arousal in humans has been developed by<br>Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the<br>key eliciting factors for the arousal of<br>emotions within this theory are expectations states<br>and sanctions. When people enter a situation<br>or encounter with certain expectations for how<br>the encounter should unfold, they will experience<br>different emotions depending on the extent to<br>which expectations for Self, other and situation<br>are met or not met. People can<br>also provide positive or negative sanctions directed<br>at Self or other which also trigger<br>different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed<br>a wide range of emotion theories across<br>different fields of research including sociology, psychology,<br>evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this<br>analysis, he identified four emotions that all<br>researchers consider being founded on human neurology<br>including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These<br>four categories are called primary emotions and<br>there is some agreement amongst researchers that<br>these primary emotions become combined to produce<br>more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These<br>more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations<br>in Turner's theory and they include sentiments<br>such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions<br>can also be experienced at different levels<br>of intensity so that feelings of concern<br>are a low-intensity variation of the primary<br>emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher<br>intensity variant.",

          "<b>Emotion</b><br>The idea that core affect is but<br>one component of the emotion led to<br>a theory called “psychological construction.” According to<br>this theory, an emotional episode consists of<br>a set of components, each of which<br>is an ongoing process and none of<br>which is necessary or sufficient for the<br>emotion to be instantiated. The set of<br>components is not fixed, either by human<br>evolutionary history or by social norms and<br>roles.

          "<b>Emotion</b><br>Walter Bradford Cannon agreed that physiological responses<br>played a crucial role in emotions, but<br>did not believe that physiological responses alone<br>could explain subjective emotional experiences.

He also believed that<br>the richness, variety, and temporal course of<br>emotional experiences could not stem from physiological<br>reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or<br>flight responses.

          "<b>Emotion</b><br>A situated perspective on emotion, developed by<br>Paul E.

In contrast,<br>a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion<br>as the product of an organism investigating<br>its environment, and observing the responses of<br>other organisms. Emotion stimulates the evolution of<br>social relationships, acting as a signal to<br>mediate the behavior of other organisms. In<br>some contexts, the expression of emotion (both<br>voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as<br>strategic moves in the transactions between different<br>organisms. The situated perspective on emotion states<br>that conceptual thought is not an inherent<br>part of emotion, since emotion is an<br>action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the<br>world.

These characteristics are shared with other<br>species and taxa and are due to<br>the effects of genes and their continuous<br>transmission. Information that is encoded in the<br>DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling<br>proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes<br>require genetic information from their parental germ<br>cells, and at every speciation event, heritable<br>traits that have enabled its ancestor to<br>survive and reproduce successfully are passed down<br>along with new traits that could be<br>potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the<br>five million years since the linages leading<br>to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only<br>about 1.2% of their genetic material has<br>been modified. This suggests that everything that<br>separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded<br>in that very small amount of DNA,<br>including our behaviors. Students that study animal<br>behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of<br>gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.)<br>minor genetic differences have been identified in<br>a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to<br>major species differences in social organization and<br>the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005).<br>Another potential example with behavioral differences is<br>the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in<br>neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem<br>et al. 2005).

Emotions are brief<br>in duration and consist of a coordinated<br>set of responses, which may include verbal,<br>physiological, behavioural, and neural mechanisms. Psychotherapist Michael<br>C. Graham describes all emotions as existing<br>on a continuum of intensity. Thus fear<br>might range from mild concern to terror<br>or shame might range from simple embarrassment<br>to toxic shame. Emotions have also been<br>described as biologically given and a result<br>of evolution because they provided good solutions<br>to ancient and recurring problems that faced<br>our ancestors.

Another classic study found<br>that when participants contorted their facial muscles<br>into distinct facial expressions (e.g. disgust), they<br>reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched<br>the distinct facial expressions.

          "<b>Emotion</b><br>Western philosophy regarded emotion in varying ways.<br>In stoic theories it was seen as<br>a hindrance to reason and therefore a<br>hindrance to virtue. Aristotle believed that emotions<br>were an essential component of virtue. In<br>the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions)<br>corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the<br>Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted<br>and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas<br>Aquinas in particular. There are also theories<br>of emotions in the works of philosophers<br>such as René Descartes, Niccolò Machiavelli, Baruch<br>Spinoza and David Hume.

In his theory, James proposed<br>that the perception of what he called<br>an \"exciting fact\" directly led to a<br>physiological response, known as \"emotion.\" To account<br>for different types of emotional experiences, James<br>proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the<br>autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces<br>an emotional experience in the brain. The<br>Danish psychologist Carl Lange also proposed a<br>similar theory at around the same time,<br>and therefore this theory became known as<br>the James–Lange theory. As James wrote, \"the<br>perception of bodily changes, as they occur,<br>is the emotion.\" James further claims that<br>\"we feel sad because we cry, angry<br>because we strike, afraid because we tremble,<br>and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble<br>because we are sorry, angry, or fearful,<br>as the case may be.\"",

          "<b>Emotion</b><br>Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the<br>earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio<br>Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and<br>subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly,<br>Marañón found that most of these patients<br>felt something but in the absence of<br>an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were<br>unable to interpret their physiological arousal as<br>an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that<br>physiological reactions played a big role in<br>emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed<br>to emotional experience by facilitating a focused<br>cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing<br>event and that this appraisal was what<br>defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were<br>thus a result of two-stage process: general<br>physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For<br>example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in<br>a response to an evoking stimulus, the<br>sight of a bear in the kitchen.<br>The brain then quickly scans the area,<br>to explain the pounding, and notices the<br>bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding<br>heart as being the result of fearing<br>the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer,<br>Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different<br>emotional reactions despite being placed into the<br>same physiological state with an injection of<br>epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either<br>anger or amusement depending on whether another<br>person in the situation (a confederate) displayed<br>that emotion. Hence, the combination of the<br>appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the<br>participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo<br>together determined the response.

During every encounter, he proposed<br>that we monitor ourselves through the \"looking<br>glass\" that the gestures and reactions of<br>others provide.

As<br>a result, its political, legal, linguistic and<br>cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak<br>of its power, the phrase \"the empire<br>on which the sun never sets\" was<br>often used to describe the British Empire,<br>because its expanse around the globe meant<br>that the sun was always shining on<br>at least one of its territories.",

          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>The transition from the mandolino to the<br>mandolin began around 1744 with the designing<br>of the metal-string mandolin by the Vinaccia<br>family, 3 brass strings and one of<br>gut, using friction tuning pegs on a<br>fingerboard that sat \"flush\" with the sound<br>table. The mandolin grew in popularity over<br>the next 60 years, in the streets<br>where it was used by young men<br>courting and by street musicians, and in<br>the concert hall. After the Napoleonic Wars<br>of 1815, however, its popularity began to<br>fall. The 19th century produced some prominent<br>players, including Bartolomeo Bortolazzi of Venice and<br>Pietro Vimercati. However, professional virtuosity was in<br>decline, and the mandolin music changed as<br>the mandolin became a folk instrument; \"the<br>large repertoire of notated instrumental music for<br>the mandolino and the mandoline was completely<br>forgotten\".

          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>Like any plucked instrument, mandolin notes decay<br>to silence rather than sound out continuously<br>as with a bowed note on a<br>violin, and mandolin notes decay faster than<br>larger stringed instruments like the guitar. This<br>encourages the use of tremolo (rapid picking<br>of one or more pairs of strings)<br>to create sustained notes or chords. The<br>mandolin's paired strings facilitate this technique: the<br>plectrum (pick) strikes each of a pair<br>of strings alternately, providing a more full<br>and continuous sound than a single string<br>would.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>The Neapolitan style has an almond-shaped body<br>resembling a bowl, constructed from curved strips<br>of wood.

A hardwood fingerboard sits on top<br>of or is flush with the sound<br>table. Very old instruments may use wooden<br>tuning pegs, while newer instruments tend to<br>use geared metal tuners. The bridge is<br>a movable length of hardwood. A pickguard<br>is glued below the sound hole under<br>the strings.

          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>Another family of bowlback mandolins came from<br>Milan and Lombardy. These mandolins are closer<br>to the mandolino or mandore than other<br>modern mandolins.

          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>Samuel Adelstein described the Lombardi mandolin in<br>1893 as wider and shorter than the<br>Neapolitan mandolin, with a shallower back and<br>a shorter and wider neck, with six<br>single strings to the regular mandolin's set<br>of 4. The Lombardi was tuned C,<br>D, A, E, B, G. The strings<br>were fastened to the bridge like a<br>guitar's. There were 20 frets, covering three<br>octaves, with an additional 5 notes. When<br>Adelstein wrote, there were no nylon strings,<br>and the gut and single strings \"do<br>not vibrate so clearly and sweetly as<br>the double steel string of the Neapolitan.\"",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>In his 1805 mandolin method, Anweisung die<br>Mandoline von selbst zu erlernen nebst einigen<br>Uebungsstucken von Bortolazzi, Bartolomeo Bortolazzi popularised the<br>Cremonese mandolin, which had four single-strings and<br>a fixed bridge, to which the strings<br>were attached. Bortolazzi said in this book<br>that the new wire strung mandolins were<br>uncomfortable to play, when compared with the<br>gut-string instruments. Also, he felt they had<br>a \"less pleasing...hard, zither-like tone\" as compared<br>to the gut string's \"softer, full-singing tone.\"<br>He favored the four single strings of<br>the Cremonese instrument, which were tuned the<br>same as the Neapolitan.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>At the very end of the 19th<br>century, a new style, with a carved<br>top and back construction inspired by violin<br>family instruments began to supplant the European-style<br>bowl-back instruments in the United States. This<br>new style is credited to mandolins designed<br>and built by Orville Gibson, a Kalamazoo,<br>Michigan luthier who founded the \"Gibson Mandolin-Guitar<br>Manufacturing Co., Limited\" in 1902. Gibson mandolins<br>evolved into two basic styles: the Florentine<br>or F-style, which has a decorative scroll<br>near the neck, two points on the<br>lower body and usually a scroll carved<br>into the headstock; and the A-style, which<br>is pear shaped, has no points and<br>usually has a simpler headstock.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>These styles generally have either two f-shaped<br>soundholes like a violin (F-5 and A-5),<br>or an oval sound hole (F-4 and<br>A-4 and lower models) directly under the<br>strings. Much variation exists between makers working<br>from these archetypes, and other variants have<br>become increasingly common. Generally, in the United<br>States, Gibson F-hole F-5 mandolins and mandolins<br>influenced by that design are strongly associated<br>with bluegrass, while the A-style is associated<br>other types of music, although it too<br>is most often used for and associated<br>with bluegrass. The F-5's more complicated woodwork<br>also translates into a more expensive instrument.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>Numerous modern mandolin makers build instruments that<br>largely replicate the Gibson F-5 Artist models<br>built in the early 1920s under the<br>supervision of Gibson acoustician Lloyd Loar.

          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>The mandolin's popularity in the United States<br>was spurred by the success of a<br>group of touring young European musicians known<br>as the Estudiantina Figaro, or in the<br>United States, simply the \"Spanish Students.\" The<br>group landed in the U.S. on January<br>2, 1880 in New York City, and<br>played in Boston and New York to<br>wildly enthusiastic crowds. Ironically, this ensemble did<br>not play mandolins but rather bandurrias, which<br>are also small, double-strung instruments that resemble<br>the mandolin. The success of the Figaro<br>Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated<br>their musical style and costumes. An Italian<br>musician, Carlo Curti, hastily started a musical<br>ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students<br>perform; his group of Italian born Americans<br>called themselves the \"Original Spanish Students,\" counting<br>on the American public to not know<br>the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and<br>Italian mandolins. The imitators' use of mandolins<br>helped to generate enormous public interest in<br>an instrument previously relatively unknown in the<br>United States.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>Mandolin awareness in the United States blossomed<br>in the 1880s, as the instrument became<br>part of a fad that continued into<br>the mid-1920s. According to Clarence L. Partee,<br>the first mandolin made in the United<br>States was made in 1883 or 1884<br>by Joseph Bohmann, who was an established<br>maker of violins in Chicago. Partee characterized<br>the early instrument as being larger than<br>the European instruments he was used to,<br>with a \"peculiar shape\" and \"crude construction,\"<br>and said that the quality improved, until<br>American instruments were \"superior\" to imported instruments.<br>At the time, Partee was using an<br>imported French-made mandolin.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>Instruments were marketed by teacher-dealers, much as<br>the title character in the popular musical<br>The Music Man. Often, these teacher-dealers conducted<br>mandolin orchestras: groups of 4-50 musicians who<br>played various mandolin family instruments. However, alongside<br>the teacher-dealers were serious musicians, working to<br>create a spot for the instrument in<br>classical music, ragtime and jazz. Like the<br>teacher-dealers, they traveled the U.S., recording records,<br>giving performances and teaching individuals and mandolin<br>orchestras. Samuel Siegel played mandolin in Vaudeville<br>and became one of America's preeminent mandolinists.<br>Seth Weeks was an African American who<br>not only taught and performed in the<br>United States, but also in Europe, where<br>he recorded records. Another pioneering African American<br>musician and director who made his start<br>with a mandolin orchestra was composer James<br>Reese Europe. W.

          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>The instrument was primarily used in an<br>ensemble setting well into the 1930s, and<br>although the fad died out at the<br>beginning of the 1930s, the instruments that<br>were developed for the orchestra found a<br>new home in bluegrass. The famous Lloyd<br>Loar Master Model from Gibson (1923) was<br>designed to boost the flagging interest in<br>mandolin ensembles, with little success. However, The<br>\"Loar\" became the defining instrument of bluegrass<br>music when Bill Monroe purchased F-5 S/N<br>73987 in a Florida barbershop in 1943<br>and popularized it as his main instrument.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>The mandolin orchestras never completely went away,<br>however. In fact, along with all the<br>other musical forms the mandolin is involved<br>with, the mandolin ensemble (groups usually arranged<br>like the string section of a modern<br>symphony orchestra, with first mandolins, second mandolins,<br>mandolas, mandocellos, mando-basses, and guitars, and sometimes<br>supplemented by other instruments) continues to grow<br>in popularity. Since the mid-nineties, several public-school<br>mandolin-based guitar programs have blossomed around the<br>country, including Fretworks Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra,<br>the first of its kind. The national<br>organization, Classical Mandolin Society of America, founded<br>by Norman Levine, represents these groups. Prominent<br>modern mandolinists and composers for mandolin in<br>the classical music tradition include Samuel Firstman,<br>Howard Fry, Rudy Cipolla, Dave Apollon, Neil<br>Gladd, Evan Marshall, Marilynn Mair and Mark<br>Davis (the Mair-Davis Duo), Brian Israel, David<br>Evans, Emanuil Shynkman, Radim Zenkl, David Del<br>Tredici and Ernst Krenek.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>When Cowan Powers and his family recorded<br>their old-time music from 1924-1926, his daughter<br>Orpha Powers was one of the earliest<br>known southern-music artists to record with the<br>mandolin. By the 1930s, single mandolins were<br>becoming more commonly used in southern string<br>band music, most notably by brother duets<br>such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys<br>(Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick) and the<br>more hard-driving Monroe Brothers (Bill Monroe and<br>Charlie Monroe). However, the mandolin's modern popularity<br>in country music can be directly traced<br>to one man: Bill Monroe, the father<br>of bluegrass music. After the Monroe Brothers<br>broke up in 1939, Bill Monroe formed<br>his own group, after a brief time<br>called the Blue Grass Boys, and completed<br>the transition of mandolin styles from a<br>\"parlor\" sound typical of brother duets to<br>the modern \"bluegrass\" style. He joined the<br>Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its<br>powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread<br>his style throughout the South, directly inspiring<br>many musicians to take up the mandolin.<br>Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin, signed<br>and dated July 9, 1923, by Lloyd<br>Loar, chief acoustic engineer at Gibson. The<br>F-5 has since become the most imitated<br>tonally and aesthetically by modern builders.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>Monroe's style involved playing lead melodies in<br>the style of a fiddler, and also<br>a percussive chording sound referred to as<br>\"the chop\" for the sound made by<br>the quickly struck and muted strings. He<br>also perfected a sparse, percussive blues style,<br>especially up the neck in keys that<br>had not been used much in country<br>music, notably B and E. He emphasized<br>a powerful, syncopated right hand at the<br>expense of left-hand virtuosity. Monroe's most influential<br>follower of the second generation is Frank<br>Wakefield and nowadays Mike Compton of the<br>Nashville Bluegrass Band and David Long, who<br>often tour as a duet. Tiny Moore<br>of the Texas Playboys developed an electric<br>five-string mandolin and helped popularize the instrument<br>in Western Swing music.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>Other major bluegrass mandolinists who emerged in<br>the early 1950s and are still active<br>include Jesse McReynolds (of Jim and Jesse)<br>who invented a syncopated banjo-roll-like style called<br>crosspicking—and Bobby Osborne of the Osborne Brothers,<br>who is a master of clarity and<br>sparkling single-note runs. Highly respected and influential<br>modern bluegrass players include Herschel Sizemore, Doyle<br>Lawson, and the multi-genre Sam Bush, who<br>is equally at home with old-time fiddle<br>tunes, rock, reggae, and jazz. Ronnie McCoury<br>of the Del McCoury Band has won<br>numerous awards for his Monroe-influenced playing. The<br>late John Duffey of the original Country<br>Gentlemen and later the Seldom Scene did<br>much to popularize the bluegrass mandolin among<br>folk and urban audiences, especially on the<br>east coast and in the Washington, D.C.<br>area.",
          "<b>Mandolin</b><br>Jethro Burns, best known as half of<br>the comedy duo Homer and Jethro, was<br>also the first important jazz mandolinist.

The band<br>explains that these instruments accentuate the growling<br>sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit<br>\"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a<br>few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist<br>Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin<br>in nearly a dozen other songs. The<br>single peaked at No. 4 on the<br>Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the<br>rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of<br>North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes<br>has made frequent use of the mandolin,<br>most notably on the Black Crowes song<br>\"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System<br>of A Down makes extensive use of<br>the mandolin on their 2005 double album<br>Mezmerize/Hypnotize.

Namely, God is seen<br>as begetter of the world and revelation<br>which corresponds to the active (as opposed<br>to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse.",
          "<b>God</b><br>Prayer plays a significant role among many<br>believers. Muslims believe that the purpose of<br>existence is to worship God. He is<br>viewed as a personal God and there<br>are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to<br>contact God. Prayer often also includes supplication<br>and asking forgiveness. God is often believed<br>to be forgiving. For example, a hadith<br>states God would replace a sinless people<br>with one who sinned but still asked<br>repentance. Christian theologian Alister McGrath writes that<br>there are good reasons to suggest that<br>a \"personal god\" is integral to the<br>Christian outlook, but that one has to<br>understand it is an analogy. \"To say<br>that God is like a person is<br>to affirm the divine ability and willingness<br>to relate to others. This does not<br>imply that God is human, or located<br>at a specific point in the universe.\"",
          "<b>God</b><br>Adherents of different religions generally disagree as<br>to how to best worship God and<br>what is God's plan for mankind, if<br>there is one. There are different approaches<br>to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic<br>religions. One view is taken by exclusivists,<br>who believe they are the chosen people<br>or have exclusive access to absolute truth,<br>generally through revelation or encounter with the<br>Divine, which adherents of other religions do<br>not. Another view is religious pluralism. A<br>pluralist typically believes that his religion is<br>the right one, but does not deny<br>the partial truth of other religions. An<br>example of a pluralist view in Christianity<br>is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's<br>religion is the fulfillment of previous religions.<br>A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where<br>everybody is seen as equally right; an<br>example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation<br>is eventually available for everyone. A fourth<br>approach is syncretism, mixing different elements from<br>different religions. An example of syncretism is<br>the New Age movement.",
          "<b>God</b><br>Many medieval philosophers developed arguments for the<br>existence of God, while attempting to comprehend<br>the precise implications of God's attributes. Reconciling<br>some of those attributes generated important philosophical<br>problems and debates. For example, God's omniscience<br>may seem to imply that God knows<br>how free agents will choose to act.<br>If God does know this, their ostensible<br>free will might be illusory, or foreknowledge<br>does not imply predestination, and if God<br>does not know it, God may not<br>be omniscient.",

The theist response has been<br>either to contend, as does Alvin Plantinga,<br>that faith is \"properly basic\", or to<br>take, as does Richard Swinburne, the evidentialist<br>position. Some theists agree that none of<br>the arguments for God's existence are compelling,<br>but argue that faith is not a<br>product of reason, but requires risk. There<br>would be no risk, they say, if<br>the arguments for God's existence were as<br>solid as the laws of logic, a<br>position summed up by Pascal as \"the<br>heart has reasons of which reason does<br>not know.\" A recent theory using concepts<br>from physics and neurophysiology proposes that God<br>can be conceptualized within the theory of<br>integrative level.",

During the Reign of Terror a<br>statue of a woman titled liberty, painted<br>red, was placed in the square in<br>front of the guillotine. After the end<br>of the Reign of Terror, France went<br>back to the blue, white and red<br>tricolor, whose red was taken from the<br>traditional color of Saint Denis, the Christian<br>martyr and patron saint of Paris.",

The fabric was more<br>expensive but resulted in a fine bright<br>and lasting red, similar to carmine, perfectly<br>suited to cotton.

These studies were avidly<br>followed by artists such as Vincent van<br>Gogh. Describing his painting, The Night Cafe,<br>to his brother Theo in 1888, Van<br>Gogh wrote: \"I sought to express with<br>red and green the terrible human passions.<br>The hall is blood red and pale<br>yellow, with a green billiard table in<br>the center, and four lamps of lemon<br>yellow, with rays of orange and green.<br>Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis<br>of the most different reds and greens.\"",

In addition to stipulations<br>of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret<br>protocol that divided territories of Romania, Poland,<br>Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland into German<br>and Soviet \"spheres of influence\", anticipating potential<br>\"territorial and political rearrangements\" of these countries.<br>Thereafter, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September<br>1939. After the Soviet–Japanese ceasefire agreement took<br>effect on 16 September, Stalin ordered his<br>own invasion of Poland on 17 September.<br>Part of southeastern (Karelia) and Salla region<br>in Finland were annexed by the Soviet<br>Union after the Winter War. This was<br>followed by Soviet annexations of Estonia, Latvia,<br>Lithuania, and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, Northern<br>Bukovina, and the Hertza region). Concern about<br>ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been proffered<br>as justification for the Soviet invasion of<br>Poland.

Moreover, the anti-Semitic Nazis associated<br>ethnic Jews with both communism and financial<br>capitalism, both of which they opposed. Consequently,<br>Nazi theory held that Slavs in the<br>Soviet Union were being ruled by \"Jewish<br>Bolshevik\" masters. In 1934, Hitler himself had<br>spoken of an inescapable battle against both<br>Pan-Slavism and Neo-Slavism, the victory in which<br>would lead to \"permanent mastery of the<br>world\", though he stated that they would<br>\"walk part of the road with the<br>Russians, if that will help us.\" The<br>resulting manifestation of German anti-Bolshevism and an<br>increase in Soviet foreign debts caused German–Soviet<br>trade to dramatically decline.[b] Imports of Soviet<br>goods to Germany fell to 223 million<br>Reichsmarks in 1934 as the more isolationist<br>Stalinist regime asserted power and the abandonment<br>of post–World War I Treaty of Versailles<br>military controls decreased Germany's reliance on Soviet<br>imports.[clarification needed]",
          "<b>Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact</b><br>Hitler's fierce anti-Soviet rhetoric was one of<br>the reasons why the UK and France<br>decided that Soviet participation in the 1938<br>Munich Conference regarding Czechoslovakia would be both<br>dangerous and useless. The Munich Agreement that<br>followed marked a partial German annexation of<br>Czechoslovakia in late 1938 followed by its<br>complete dissolution in March 1939, which as<br>part of the appeasement of Germany conducted<br>by Chamberlain's and Daladier's cabinets. This policy<br>immediately raised the question of whether the<br>Soviet Union could avoid being next on<br>Hitler's list. The Soviet leadership believed that<br>the West wanted to encourage German aggression<br>in the East and that France and<br>Britain might stay neutral in a war<br>initiated by Germany, hoping that the warring<br>states would wear each other out and<br>put an end to both the Soviet<br>Union and Nazi Germany.",

          "<b>Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact</b><br>The Soviet Union, which feared Western powers<br>and the possibility of \"capitalist encirclements\", had<br>little faith either that war could be<br>avoided, or faith in the Polish army,<br>and wanted nothing less than an ironclad<br>military alliance with France and Britain that<br>would provide a guaranteed support for a<br>two-pronged attack on Germany; thus, Stalin's adherence<br>to the collective security line was purely<br>conditional. Britain and France believed that war<br>could still be avoided, and that the<br>Soviet Union, weakened by the Great Purge,<br>could not be a main military participant,<br>a point that many military sources were<br>at variance with, especially Soviet victories over<br>the Japanese Kwantung army on the Manchurian<br>frontier. France was more anxious to find<br>an agreement with the USSR than was<br>Britain; as a continental power, it was<br>more willing to make concessions, more fearful<br>of the dangers of an agreement between<br>the USSR and Germany.

The<br>USSR proposed to consider that a political<br>turn towards Germany by the Baltic states<br>would constitute an \"indirect aggression\" towards the<br>Soviet Union. Britain opposed such proposals, because<br>they feared the Soviets' proposed language could<br>justify a Soviet intervention in Finland and<br>the Baltic states, or push those countries<br>to seek closer relations with Germany. The<br>discussion about a definition of \"indirect aggression\"<br>became one of the sticking points between<br>the parties, and by mid-July, the tripartite<br>political negotiations effectively stalled, while the parties<br>agreed to start negotiations on a military<br>agreement, which the Soviets insisted must be<br>entered into simultaneously with any political agreement.",

The<br>ensuing discussion of a potential political deal<br>between Germany and the Soviet Union had<br>to be channeled into the framework of<br>economic negotiations between the two countries, because<br>close military and diplomatic connections, as was<br>the case before the mid-1930s, had afterward<br>been largely severed. In May, Stalin replaced<br>his Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, who was<br>regarded as pro-western and who was also<br>Jewish, with Vyacheslav Molotov, allowing the Soviet<br>Union more latitude in discussions with more<br>parties, not only with Britain and France.",

Newspapers,<br>radio and television studios used sixteen languages,<br>fourteen were used as languages of tuition<br>in schools, and nine at universities.

Serbo-Croatian was a kind of<br>soft standardisation. However, legal equality could not<br>dampen the prestige Serbo-Croatian had: since it<br>was the language of three quarters of<br>the population, it functioned as an unofficial<br>lingua franca. And within Serbo-Croatian, the Serbian<br>variant, with twice as many speakers as<br>the Croatian, enjoyed greater prestige, reinforced by<br>the fact that Slovene and Macedonian speakers<br>preferred it to the Croatian variant because<br>their languages are also Ekavian. This is<br>a common situation in other pluricentric languages,<br>e.g. the variants of German differ according<br>to their prestige, the variants of Portuguese<br>too.

It should also be noted<br>that, in the pre-national era, Catholic religious<br>orientation did not necessarily equate with Croat<br>ethnic identity in Dalmatia. A Croatian follower<br>of Vuk Karadžić, Ivan Broz, noted that<br>for a Dalmatian to identify oneself as<br>a Serb was seen as foreign as<br>identifying oneself as Macedonian or Greek. Vatroslav<br>Jagić pointed out in 1864:",
          "<b>Serbo-Croatian</b><br>The luxurious and ornate representative texts of<br>Serbo-Croatian Church Slavonic belong to the later<br>era, when they coexisted with the Serbo-Croatian<br>vernacular literature. The most notable are the<br>\"Missal of Duke Novak\" from the Lika<br>region in northwestern Croatia (1368), \"Evangel from<br>Reims\" (1395, named after the town of<br>its final destination), Hrvoje's Missal from Bosnia<br>and Split in Dalmatia (1404), and the<br>first printed book in Serbo-Croatian, the Glagolitic<br>Missale Romanum Glagolitice (1483).",
          "<b>Serbo-Croatian</b><br>In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers,<br>linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica<br>srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi<br>Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion<br>stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a<br>single language with two equal variants that<br>have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade<br>(eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal<br>status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and<br>of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also<br>specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name<br>of the language in official contexts, while<br>in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and<br>Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska<br>and Matica srpska were to work together<br>on a dictionary, and a committee of<br>Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to<br>prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both<br>books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin<br>in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi<br>Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it<br>was an act of unitarianism. The evidence<br>supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist<br>Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission<br>from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet—<br>which was true, but was not proof<br>of unequal rights, but of frequency of<br>use and prestige. Babić further complained that<br>the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side<br>by side words from both the Croatian<br>and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which<br>one can view as proof of careful<br>respect for both variants, and not of<br>unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts<br>of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that<br>were written by Croatian linguists. And finally,<br>Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the<br>material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from<br>the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these<br>facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on<br>the Status and Name of the Croatian<br>Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of<br>the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly<br>journal Forum published the Declaration again in<br>2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.",
          "<b>Serbo-Croatian</b><br>In addition, like most Slavic languages, the<br>Shtokavian verb also has one of two<br>aspects: perfective or imperfective. Most verbs come<br>in pairs, with the perfective verb being<br>created out of the imperfective by adding<br>a prefix or making a stem change.<br>The imperfective aspect typically indicates that the<br>action is unfinished, in progress, or repetitive;<br>while the perfective aspect typically denotes that<br>the action was completed, instantaneous, or of<br>limited duration. Some Štokavian tenses (namely, aorist<br>and imperfect) favor a particular aspect (but<br>they are rarer or absent in Čakavian<br>and Kajkavian). Actually, aspects \"compensate\" for the<br>relative lack of tenses, because aspect of<br>the verb determines whether the act is<br>completed or in progress in the referred<br>time.",
          "<b>Serbo-Croatian</b><br>The jat-reflex rules are not without exception.<br>For example, when short jat is preceded<br>by r, in most Ijekavian dialects developed<br>into /re/ or, occasionally, /ri/. The prefix<br>prě- (\"trans-, over-\") when long became pre-<br>in eastern Ijekavian dialects but to prije-<br>in western dialects; in Ikavian pronunciation, it<br>also evolved into pre- or prije- due<br>to potential ambiguity with pri- (\"approach, come<br>close to\"). For verbs that had -ěti<br>in their infinitive, the past participle ending<br>-ěl evolved into -io in Ijekavian Neoštokavian.",
          "<b>Serbo-Croatian</b><br>On the other hand, the opinion of<br>Jagić from 1864 is argued not to<br>have firm grounds. When Jagić says \"Croatian\",<br>he refers to a few cases referring<br>to the Dubrovnik vernacular as ilirski (Illyrian).<br>This was a common name for all<br>Slavic vernaculars in Dalmatian cities among the<br>Roman inhabitants. In the meantime, other written<br>monuments are found that mention srpski, lingua<br>serviana (= Serbian), and some that mention<br>Croatian. By far the most competent Serbian<br>scientist on the Dubrovnik language issue, Milan<br>Rešetar, who was born in Dubrovnik himself,<br>wrote behalf of language characteristics: \"The one<br>who thinks that Croatian and Serbian are<br>two separate languages must confess that Dubrovnik<br>always (linguistically) used to be Serbian.\"",
          "<b>Serbo-Croatian</b><br>Nationalists have conflicting views about the language(s).<br>The nationalists among the Croats conflictingly claim<br>either that they speak an entirely separate<br>language from Serbs and Bosnians or that<br>these two peoples have, due to the<br>longer lexicographic tradition among Croats, somehow \"borrowed\"<br>their standard languages from them.[citation needed] Bosniak<br>nationalists claim that both Croats and Serbs<br>have \"appropriated\" the Bosnian language, since Ljudevit<br>Gaj and Vuk Karadžić preferred the Neoštokavian-Ijekavian<br>dialect, widely spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina,<br>as the basis for language standardization, whereas<br>the nationalists among the Serbs claim either<br>that any divergence in the language is<br>artificial, or claim that the Štokavian dialect<br>is theirs and the Čakavian Croats'— in<br>more extreme formulations Croats have \"taken\" or<br>\"stolen\" their language from the Serbs.[citation needed]",
          "<b>Serbo-Croatian</b><br>In Serbia, the Serbian language is the<br>official one, while both Serbian and Croatian<br>are official in the province of Vojvodina.<br>A large Bosniak minority is present in<br>the southwest region of Sandžak, but the<br>\"official recognition\" of Bosnian language is moot.<br>Bosnian is an optional course in 1st<br>and 2nd grade of the elementary school,<br>while it is also in official use<br>in the municipality of Novi Pazar. However,<br>its nomenclature is controversial, as there is<br>incentive that it is referred to as<br>\"Bosniak\" (bošnjački) rather than \"Bosnian\" (bosanski) (see<br>Bosnian language for details).",
